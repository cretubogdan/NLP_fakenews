1,"But the episode underscored that Mr. Trump obtains, processes and uses information differently from any modern president. He watches television at night and tends to incorporate what he sees into his Twitter feed, speeches and interviews.
“It begs the question of where the president gets his information as he articulates his administration’s global approach,” said Mark Brzezinski, the ambassador to Sweden under President Barack Obama. “To do so in an improvisational way, based on snippets picked up from cable news, is a major mistake.”
Immigration is a hotly debated issue in Sweden, Germany and many other European countries. Sweden, which prides itself as a humanitarian leader, processed a record 163,000 asylum applications in 2015. But statistics in Sweden do not back up the suggestion that immigrants have created a major crime wave.
Preliminary data released last month by Sweden’s crime prevention council found no significant increase in crimes from 2015 to 2016, even with the influx of migrants. The council did note an increase in assaults and rapes last year, but it also recorded a drop in thefts and drug offenses. Still, a Pew Research Center survey last year found that 46 percent of Swedes said refugees were more to blame for crime than other groups.
Manne Gerell, a doctoral student in criminology at Malmo University in Sweden, said in an interview that immigrants were disproportionately represented among crime suspects, particularly in more serious and violent offenses. But he noted that many of the victims were other immigrants, whether members of criminal networks or simply residents of poor neighborhoods.
“Immigration will come with some cost, and we will likely have a bit more crime — but that’s in a society with low crime rates and in a society that works really well, so in my opinion, it’s something we can live with,” he said. “I know everybody won’t agree with that. But immigration will not double the crime rate, make everybody go broke or turn Sweden into a living hell.”
Although terrorism is a concern for Sweden — an Iraqi-born Swede blew himself up in central Stockholm in 2010 — the authorities say they are equally worried about racist hate crimes, including attacks on migrants.",negative
2,"The German government is weighing potential hefty fines for tech giants like Google and Facebook, whose platforms allow false stories to be quickly circulated. The companies insist that they cannot be held responsible because they do not generate the stories.
Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany’s domestic intelligence service, said that although there was no “smoking gun,” Russia was likely to be involved in the increase in online misinformation aimed at destabilizing German politics.
“What makes cyberattacks so sexy for foreign powers is that it is nearly impossible to find a smoking gun,” Mr. Maassen said in an interview with Phoenix TV Feb. 12. “It is always possible to cover your tracks and operate undercover.”
American tech giants also have stepped in after they were accused of not doing enough to counter false reports on their platforms, accusations that Facebook, Google and other companies deny. They are now funding initiatives in the United States, France and elsewhere to flag fake news online and remove posts if they are found to violate companies’ terms of use or local laws.
“This isn’t just about debunking falsehoods,” said Jenni Sargent, the managing director of First Draft News, a nonprofit that is partly funded by Google and expanding rapidly in France ahead of the country’s elections, as well as across Europe and beyond. “What we’re trying to do is to deal with the content as opposed to the source.”
Such efforts across Europe have gained momentum since the United States’ presidential election.
Soon after Donald J. Trump’s victory in November, David Alandete gathered his team in the El País newsroom in downtown Madrid with one goal in mind: to respond to fake news.
Like many journalists, Mr. Alandete, the Spanish newspaper’s managing editor and a former United States correspondent, had seen waves of false reports during the presidential campaign, many directed at Mexico — a country that accounts for roughly half of El País’ online readership.",positive
3,"Mr. Trump would hardly be the first contentious leader to be honored with a state visit. The queen, acting as always on the recommendation of the government, has in the past received President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and President Mobutu Sese Seko, the former leader of Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. After a recent visit with President Xi Jinping of China, she was caught on camera speaking of how “very rude” the Chinese leader had been.
“A queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride,” William Hague, a former foreign secretary, wrote in The Daily Telegraph.
Still, the prospect of Mr. Trump’s visit has stirred great passion in Britain. The online petition, backed by 1.8 million people, does not call for Mr. Trump to be barred from Britain altogether, only that his visit be a political one, without the involvement of Queen Elizabeth II.
Another online petition, signed by more than 300,000 people, called for the state visit to take place. Petitions with more than 100,000 signatures are eligible for parliamentary debate, and any vote would not be binding. The government of Prime Minister Theresa May has been firm in saying that the invitation to Mr. Trump for a full state visit this year will not be withdrawn.
In Parliament, Mr. Flynn cited the need to keep public trust in politicians and noted that no president had ever been invited for a state visit in his first year in office. He also accused Mr. Trump of acting “like a petulant child” and said the queen should not be seen as approving either his actions or his attitudes toward women and Muslims.",positive
4,"SYDNEY, Australia — The first visit to Australia by an Israeli prime minister was intended to be a warm meeting between the leaders of two countries with strong trade ties, giving Benjamin Netanyahu some positive coverage as his nation faces broad condemnation for pushing to expand settlements on the West Bank.
But the four-day visit, scheduled to start on Wednesday, is generating a bit of pushback. Sixty notable Australians, including political, religious, cultural and business figures, have signed a letter opposing Mr. Netanyahu’s visit because of his government’s policies toward the Palestinians. And small groups of protesters have demonstrated in Melbourne and Canberra against the visit.
“Israel continues to defy all United Nations calls for it to comply with international law in respect of its illegal settlement building and its treatment of the indigenous Palestinian population,” the letter said. It called on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s administration to rethink its support of the Israeli government.
Australia was one of the few countries that spoke out against a United Nations Security Council resolution in December that condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. While Israel’s closest ally, the United States, tacitly supported the resolution, the Australian government called it “one sided” and “deeply unsettling.”",negative
5,"By that he meant he wanted to address the inability or refusal of Mr. Trump, his followers and his administration to separate the real from the fake. And so Mr. Oliver took up four Trump-related questions: How did a man with such a contempt for or poor grasp of the truth end up as president? Where are his lies coming from? Why do so many people believe them? And what can be done about it?
The first three have been thoroughly picked over by all sorts of journalistic outlets, including some conservative ones, and two-thirds of the way into Sunday night’s show it seemed as if Mr. Oliver had nothing new to add. He and his former “Daily Show” colleague Samantha Bee, on her TBS show “Full Frontal,” have taken some of the deepest dives into the surreality of the Trump ascendance, so it would have been disappointing if Sunday’s episode had simply revisited problems that have been exhaustively documented elsewhere.
But of course Mr. Oliver had something else up his sleeve. “Last Week Tonight” has in its first three seasons built a reputation for quirky advocacy, whether calling for letter-writing campaigns or — as in his last show of 2016, after the election — urging viewers to give money to threatened social causes and to support news organizations financially.
Mr. Oliver kept that tradition rolling at the end of Sunday’s segment when, after establishing that Mr. Trump seems to get much of his dubious information by watching morning cable news shows, he announced that “Last Week Tonight” would be buying advertising on those shows in the Washington area. The ads, he said, would seek to impart facts that Mr. Trump has shown he does not grasp or believe. Samples included spots featuring a folksy cowboy, which were designed to resemble catheter ads but instead related facts about the nuclear triad, the demographics of urban areas and more. The first such ad will run Monday on several outlets, Mr. Oliver said.",negative
6,"Meryl Streep, in a fiery speech criticizing President Trump on Saturday night, pledged to stand up against “brownshirts and bots” at a time when she and others are increasingly denouncing his administration’s policies and the president himself.
Ms. Streep, in New York City accepting an award from the Human Rights Campaign, referred to the backlash she received after the Golden Globes in January, when she gave a speech denouncing Mr. Trump.
“It’s terrifying to put the target on your forehead, and it sets you up for all sorts of attacks and armies of brownshirts and bots and worse, and the only way you can do it is to feel you have to,” Ms. Streep said. “You have to. You don’t have an option. You have to.”
It was not immediately clear to whom Ms. Streep was referring in using the loaded term “brownshirts,” which was originally applied to a paramilitary group that assisted the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.",negative
7,"It was an eventful week for the DeVos family of Grand Rapids, Mich. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence cast the tiebreaking vote, confirming Betsy DeVos as the Trump administration’s Secretary of Education.
On Friday, Pamella DeVos staged her New York Fashion Week runway show for the Fall-Winter 2017 collection of her evening-wear line, Pamella Roland. Pamella and Betsy are married to brothers, Dan DeVos and Dick DeVos, who are sons of Richard DeVos, a billionaire founder of Amway.
More than 300 people attended the fashion show, where they ogled aubergine crepe gowns, cashmere coats with fox fur cuffs and numerous sequined numbers, as models strode down the runway to tunes such as Michelle Gurevich’s “Russian Romance.” The education secretary, however, was not among them. Hours earlier, she was booed and harangued by protesters outside of a school in Washington that she had come to visit.
Despite her sister-in-law’s absence, in an interview backstage, Pamella said Betsy had been an ardent supporter of the fashion line since it was introduced in 2002. “She wears it beautifully; she’s tall and thin and has been one of my best customers,” the designer said.",neutral
8,"Federal workers are more likely to be Democrats, according to surveys. But partisanship and ideology explain only some of the intense feelings among workers, many of whom have seen Democrats and Republicans in the White House come and go.
At bars after work, in employee break rooms, on conference calls and on social media networks, employees at agencies targeted for steep reductions fear for their jobs. They worry about Mr. Trump’s freeze on hiring and regulations, his pledge to reverse environmental protections, and his executive order shutting down immigration for refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
Some federal workers welcome Mr. Trump’s promises to create new jobs, build infrastructure and lower taxes. Others say they are focusing on doing their jobs and trying not to be distracted by the political noise that surrounds them. Still others say they are struggling with the question of whether they want to work for a president with whom they so strongly disagree.
“What do you do,” asked Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, if you work at a place where the leader “avowedly renounces the work of that agency?”
“All of a sudden, you are faced with a real moral dilemma,” continued Mr. Connolly, whose district just outside Washington is home to thousands of federal workers.
Federal workers watched with growing alarm last year as Mr. Trump waged a campaign filled with antigovernment bombast and then during a transition in which he recruited cabinet secretaries hostile to the agencies they lead. Now they wait in these chaotic early days of Mr. Trump’s presidency as he and his political advisers use executive orders to shred the policies and traditions the workers have championed.
The intensity of feeling was already raw in late December, when members of the Digital Service gathered for drinks at the Laughing Man Tavern, a Washington bar, to say goodbye to Mikey Dickerson, their boss and the Google engineer first hired to rescue HealthCare.gov, the government’s Affordable Care Act website.",negative
9,"The former president, who was 11 when his boyhood home got running water after his father installed a windmill, did not need convincing and became deeply involved with the project, writing notes in the margins of the lease agreement and visiting the site regularly.
Mr. Carter, Jason Carter recalled this week, regularly sent pictures of the construction on the farmland, which he often passed during walks here with his wife, Rosalynn.
“When I told people we were getting solar panels, they said, ‘In Plains?’” said Jan Williams, who runs the Plains Historic Inn and helps to organize Mr. Carter’s regular Sunday school classes, which remain a draw for tourists. “They say, ‘Well, that’s because of Jimmy Carter.’ It is because of Jimmy Carter. Plains is all because of Jimmy Carter.”
The Plains project, limited in size, according to Mr. Carter and SolAmerica, because of what existing infrastructure could handle, is far from the first solar effort in Georgia. But it is among the highest-profile projects in a state where, after years of reluctance, regulators have demanded that the predominant utility company place a greater emphasis on solar power.
In this state, and in other parts of the country where many residents are unconvinced of climate change, renewable energy supporters have often tailored their pitches to focus on economic benefits. A plurality of Georgia’s electric generation jobs are in solar, according to the Department of Energy.
“The old politicized arguments about renewable energy being for coastal liberals just don’t play anymore in parts of the country where they’re experiencing firsthand the economic benefits of renewable energy development and job creation,” said Jodie Van Horn, the director of the Sierra Club’s Ready for 100 campaign, which pushes American cities to commit to entirely renewable energy offerings.
Renewable energy supporters do not have to ignore climate change arguments entirely, though. In 2014 in Sumter County, which includes Plains, 62 percent of residents believed that global warming was happening, according to an estimate from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. That is slightly higher than some counties in metropolitan Atlanta.",neutral
10,"What will you do when terrorists attack, or U.S. friction with some foreign power turns into a military confrontation? I don’t mean in your personal life, where you should keep calm and carry on. I mean politically. Think about it carefully: The fate of the republic may depend on your answer.
Of course, nobody knows whether there will be a shocking, 9/11-type event, or what form it might take. But surely there’s a pretty good chance that sometime over the next few years something nasty will happen — a terrorist attack on a public place, an exchange of fire in the South China Sea, something. Then what?
After 9/11, the overwhelming public response was to rally around the commander in chief. Doubts about the legitimacy of a president who lost the popular vote and was installed by a bare majority on the Supreme Court were swept aside. Unquestioning support for the man in the White House was, many Americans believed, what patriotism demanded.",negative
11,"If you could give Donald Trump the gift of a single trait to help his presidency, what would it be?
My first thought was that prudence was the most important gift one could give him. Prudence is the ability to govern oneself with the use of reason. It is the ability to suppress one’s impulses for the sake of long-term goals. It is the ability to see the specific circumstances in which you are placed, and to master the art of navigating within them.
My basic thought was that a prudent President Trump wouldn’t spend his mornings angrily tweeting out his resentments. A prudent Trump wouldn’t spend his afternoons barking at foreign leaders and risking nuclear war. “Prudence is what differentiates action from impulse and heroes from hotheads,” writes the French philosopher André Comte-Sponville.
But the more I thought about it the more I realized prudence might not be the most important trait Trump needs. He seems intent on destroying the postwar world order — building walls, offending allies and driving away the stranger and the refugee. Do I really want to make him more prudent and effective in pursuit of malicious goals?
Moreover, the true Trump dysfunction seems deeper. We are used to treating politicians as vehicles for political philosophies and interest groups. But in Trump’s case, his philosophy, populism, often takes a back seat to his psychological complexes — the psychic wounds that seem to induce him into a state of perpetual war with enemies far and wide.",negative
12,"In the nearly three weeks since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, that feeling has completely dissipated.
At a barbershop in west Tehran, the Trump name was the only thing that could get a group of young men to turn away from the soccer match between Tehran’s popular Esteghlal team and a team from Qatar.
“We thought he was a businessman who would offer transactions with Iran, perhaps some investments,” said Ali Mohammadi, 26. Describing himself as a fun-loving young man seeking a decent job, Mr. Mohammadi said he was now thinking about what he would do if Iran came under bombardment someday. “It just feels as if we are powerless, at the mercy of international politics.”
When Mr. Trump started ridiculing the nuclear agreement during the presidential campaign, many in Iran thought he was merely trying to get votes.
Some middle-class Iranians, who get their news from the approximately 150 illegal Persian-language satellite channels that broadcast from overseas into Iran, started contending that Mr. Trump could actually be a blessing. His perceived friendliness toward Russia has long been seen as a plus in Iran, with many people expecting Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, to rein in Mr. Trump’s anti-Iranian stances.
“But we cannot trust the Russians to do so,” said Housang Tale, a historian who is critical of Russia’s relationship with Iran’s leaders. “They have used us throughout history, taken our land and sold us out,” he said of Russia. “Who says they won’t trade Iran with the U.S. for the Ukraine? More pressure is coming.”
Others disagreed and insisted that Iran’s cordial relations with Russia would save their country from new sanctions and military strikes. “They will not allow America to attack us,” said Malek Elyasi, who owns a motorcycle repair shop. “Any war with Iran would turn into a global conflict because the Russians will support us.”
Iran’s defiance of the United States has been a pillar of foreign policy since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the ideology of independence from world powers is widely embraced even by Iranians who do not like their government’s politically repressive behavior. But some question whether this ideology can sometimes undermine national interests.",negative
13,"Mrs. King’s letter was not flattering. (“…has used the awesome power of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.”) Neither were the quotes Warren read from the late Senator Edward Kennedy (“a disgrace”). But none of it was exactly a surprise, and all of Washington knew the nomination was eventually going to pass. Yet McConnell decided to shut down Warren, claiming she had “impugned the motives and conduct” of a fellow senator.
McConnell cited Rule 19, which is more than a century old. It comes up about once a generation, when somebody calls a colleague an idiot or a liar. But this was totally different. The other senators were startled — or would have been if most of them had not been napping or back in their offices, dialing up donors.
“She was warned,” McConnell said later. “She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”
Wow, nothing worse than a woman who won’t stop talking.
“They were waiting to Rule 19 someone and they specifically targeted Elizabeth,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. “I think because she’s effective.”
The social media exploded. You have to admit we live in wondrous times, people. There was a day when people only took to Facebook to post pictures of their vacation. On Wednesday they were pouring in to watch Elizabeth Warren read her forbidden letter.
Dark and extremely conspiratorial minds suggested the whole thing was a Republican plot to promote Warren as a presidential candidate, since they believe Trump could defeat her in 2020. This presumes that McConnell is suffering from a pathological case of advance planning.",negative

His fiancée, Sahar Fadul, had been detained late last month after arriving at Dulles International Airport from her parents’ home in Sudan and put on a plane back to Africa, the visa it had taken a year for her to acquire stamped “CANCELLED” in purple ink.

15,"Every day, the president’s behavior becomes more worrying. One day he demeans a federal judge who challenges him; the next day, without evidence, he accuses the media of hiding illegal voting or acts of terrorism. His lack of respect for institutions and truth pours out so fast, you start to forget how crazy this behavior is for any adult, let alone a president, and just how ugly things will get when we have a real crisis. And crises are baked into this story because of the incoherence of President Trump’s worldview.
How so? The world today is more interdependent than ever. The globalization of markets, the spread of cellphones, the accelerations in technology and biology, the new mass movements of migrants and the disruptions in the climate are all intertwined and impacting one another. As a result, we need a president who can connect all of these dots and navigate a path that gets the most out of them and cushions the worst.
But Trump is a dot exploiter, not connector. He made a series of reckless, unconnected promises, not much longer than tweets, to get elected, and now he’s just checking off each one, without thinking through the linkages among them or anticipating second-order effects.
It is a great way to make America weak — and overstretched — again.
Where do I start? Trump wants to get tougher with China on trade and security. That’s not crazy. But how would I do that? I’d organize an alliance of Pacific trading nations that surround China and enlist them in a trade pact that supports U.S.-style rule of law, greater market access for U.S. intellectual property and products and promotes U.S. values — as opposed to China’s. I’d call it the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP for short.",negative
16,"ROME — When Stephen K. Bannon was still heading Breitbart News, he went to the Vatican to cover the canonization of John Paul II and make some friends. High on his list of people to meet was an archconservative American cardinal, Raymond Burke, who had openly clashed with Pope Francis.
In one of the cardinal’s antechambers, amid religious statues and book-lined walls, Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon — who is now President Trump’s anti-establishment eminence — bonded over their shared worldview. They saw Islam as threatening to overrun a prostrate West weakened by the erosion of traditional Christian values, and viewed themselves as unjustly ostracized by out-of-touch political elites.
“When you recognize someone who has sacrificed in order to remain true to his principles and who is fighting the same kind of battles in the cultural arena, in a different section of the battlefield, I’m not surprised there is a meeting of hearts,” said Benjamin Harnwell, a confidant of Cardinal Burke who arranged the 2014 meeting.
While Mr. Trump, a twice-divorced president who has boasted of groping women, may seem an unlikely ally of traditionalists in the Vatican, many of them regard his election and the ascendance of Mr. Bannon as potentially game-changing breakthroughs.",negative
17,"LIVERPOOL, England — When engineers faced resistance from residents in Denmark over plans to build wind turbines on the Nordic country’s flat farmland, they found a better locale: the sea. The offshore wind farm, the world’s first, had just 11 turbines and could power about 3,000 homes.
That project now looks like a minnow compared with the whales that sprawl for miles across the seas of Northern Europe.
Off this venerable British port city, a Danish company, Dong Energy, is installing 32 turbines that stretch 600 feet high. Each turbine produces more power than that first facility.
It is precisely the size, both of the projects and the profits they can bring, that has grabbed the attention of financial institutions, money managers and private equity funds, like the investment bank Goldman Sachs, as well as wealthy individuals like the owner of the Danish toymaker Lego. As the technology has improved and demand for renewable energy has risen, costs have fallen.",negative
18,"A group of prominent Democrats who served in recent administrations, including John Kerry and Madeleine K. Albright, have called on the courts to extend a ruling blocking crucial parts of President Trump’s travel ban, saying the White House executive order would “endanger U.S. troops” and disrupt antiterrorism efforts.
The former officials expressed their concerns on Monday to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, which is considering the matter after a judge in Seattle effectively ruled that travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations as well as vetted refugees from all nations could, for now, continue to enter the United States.
With Mr. Trump’s executive order, “we risk placing our military efforts at risk by sending an insulting message” to Iraqis working with American forces battling the Islamic State there, the legal filing to the court said. “The order will likely feed the recruitment narrative of ISIL and other extremists that portray the United States as at war with Islam,” it said, using another name for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.
In addition to Mr. Kerry, a secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and Ms. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton, officials behind the filing included Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, and Leon E. Panetta, who served as secretary of defense and head of the C.I.A.",neutral

But this reboot had seriousness thrust upon it. Running a week after Donald J. Trump’s stringent immigration restrictions on seven predominantly Muslim countries, it could have been scripted straight from the president’s direst imaginings. It was, intentionally or not, a one-hour Super Bowl ad for Islamophobia.
We open on an American home defiled — family pictures, a Purple Heart, blood spatter on the walls. A jihadist kill team has slipped into the United States, slaughtering men, women and children, looking for a database of sleeper cells waiting to be activated.

20,"“If I were in the White House, I’d feel better about my position if the ban or moratorium or whatever you call it were based on an actual attack or threat,” former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, who served under Mr. Bush, said in an interview. Still, he said, when it comes to noncitizens overseas, “the executive has enjoyed great deference from the courts.”
Judge James Robart, a Federal District Court judge in Seattle appointed by Mr. Bush, on Friday issued a nationwide suspension of Mr. Trump’s order while its legality was debated. The administration quickly asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to overrule the judge, but it refused early Sunday and instead ordered the government to file a brief on Monday. The quick briefing schedule indicated that the appeals court could issue a ruling on the merits of the president’s order within days.
In the meantime, refugees vetted by the government can proceed to the United States, as can any travelers with approved visas from the seven targeted nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
Still, widespread confusion and anger were reported at overseas airports on Sunday. Unsure which orders to follow, airlines stopped even some of the people named in the lawsuits who were technically cleared to come to the country, according to a government official.
The assertion of broad latitude by the president in areas of national security resembles the struggles of the Bush years, when in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks the administration claimed sometimes sweeping power in the name of fighting terrorism.
Jack Goldsmith, who as head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under Mr. Bush argued that some of the initial orders went too far and forced them to be rolled back, said on Sunday that there were similarities. “But Bush’s legal directives were not as sloppy as Trump’s,” he said. “And Trump’s serial attacks on judges and the judiciary take us into new territory. The sloppiness and aggressiveness of the directives, combined with the attacks on judges, put extra pressure on judges to rule against Trump.”",negative
21,"President Trump’s vow to overhaul the Food and Drug Administration could bring major changes in policy, including steps to accelerate the process of approving new prescription drugs, setting up a clash with critics who say his push for deregulation might put consumers at risk.
Mr. Trump has been vetting candidates to run the agency, which regulates the safety of everything from drugs and medical devices to food and cosmetics. Among them is Jim O’Neill, a former official at the Health and Human Services Department who is an associate of the Silicon Valley billionaire and Trump supporter Peter Thiel. Mr. O’Neill has argued that companies should not have to prove that their drugs work in clinical trials before selling them to consumers.
Other candidates also have called for reducing regulatory hurdles.
If the most significant proposals are adopted — and many would require an act of Congress — they will reverse decades of policy and consumer protections dating to the 1960s. Congress toughened the drug approval process in the wake of the worldwide crisis over thalidomide, which caused severe birth defects in babies whose mothers had taken the drug in pregnancy. Since then, the F.D.A. has come to be viewed as the world’s leading watchdog for protecting the safety of food and drugs, a gold standard whose lead other countries often follow.
Mr. Trump’s most recent statements, made at a White House round-table discussion last week with leaders of the nation’s top drug companies, have reverberated throughout the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Supporters of deregulation have long wanted to reduce bureaucracy and lessen oversight of drugs and devices, while critics say the market for drugs could be destabilized and the door opened to unproven products based on junk science.",negative
22,"TOKYO — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis described Iran as the world’s greatest sponsor of terrorism on Saturday, but he emphasized that there was no pressing need for the United States to beef up its military presence in the Persian Gulf region.
“I do not see any need to increase the number of forces we have in the Middle East at this time,” Mr. Mattis said, speaking in Tokyo at a news conference as he wound up his visits to Japan and South Korea, his first foreign trip as defense secretary.
Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s national security adviser, said this week that the United States was putting Iran “on notice” because of its recent missile test and support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, whom the United States has accused of threatening American vessels in the Red Sea and attacking a Saudi Navy patrol boat.
The Trump administration imposed economic sanctions on Friday against 25 Iranians and companies that it said were connected with Iran’s missile program and the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. But so far, the White House has not announced military steps to strengthen its presence in the region. No American aircraft carrier is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf, though the Navy was expected to rotate one into the area.",neutral

In the legal back and forth over the travel ban, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco said a reply from the Trump administration was now due on Monday.
The ruling meant that travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — as well as vetted refugees from all nations could, for now, continue to enter the country. Those foreigners had been barred by an executive order signed by the president on Jan. 27.",positive
24,"President Trump’s two-for-one deal — an executive order requiring federal agencies to eliminate at least two regulations for every new one issued — sounds more like a fast-food ad than a plan for governing.
There are sound ways to streamline regulations, but boxing in regulators this way is neither advisable nor necessary. Since 2011, federal agencies have been systematically reviewing rules on the books, under a governmentwide effort begun by President Barack Obama to revise and eliminate duplicative or outdated rules and to identify regulatory gaps where new rules are needed. The “look-back” program — which brought net savings of some $37 billion over five years — makes Mr. Trump’s order all the more worrisome, because many unneeded rules have already been purged. Regulations that are necessary to protect the public, including environmental rules that safeguard health, are now at risk.
For example, the Environmental Protection Agency would have to repeal limitations on some pollutants — mercury, perhaps — in order to impose new regulations, like the updated limits on lead in drinking water that are on the agency’s agenda this year. The nation’s environmental laws do not instruct the E.P.A. to make such trade-offs, but, in effect, the executive order does. Similarly, Congress never told the Food and Drug Administration to choose among food-label accuracy, drug safety and the purity of cosmetics in carrying out the nation’s product safety laws. Mr. Trump’s executive order would force the agency to make such choices.
The order’s heavy-handedness puts environmentalists and consumer advocates on solid ground to argue in court that the two-for-one repeal formula is arbitrary and capricious, and thus illegal. But as long as the order is in force, rulemaking — a basic function of governance — will be greatly impaired.",negative
25,"Trump’s executive order barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries goes against the bedrock constitutional idea that prohibits government from favoring one religion over another. His order is a Muslim ban, as Rudolph Giuliani helpfully explained, recalling a Trump conversation. Trump himself said that Christians would be given priority over other refugees.
Now, let’s assume the Supreme Court blocks this action, following judges from lower courts, citing both equal protection and the religious establishment clause of the document Trump has sworn to uphold.
What follows could be a titanic test: Would Trump actually defy the Supreme Court? The way he has handled the fallout from the executive order shows that Trump, like any political bully, is willing to go as far as we’ll let him.
Jackson set the pattern. In 1830, he pressed Congress to pass the Indian Removal Act, displacing thousands of people and ultimately leading to the Trail of Tears. About 4,000 Cherokee died in that long march, stumbling westward in rags after their homes were looted. Two years after the act, the Supreme Court laid a foundation for Indian sovereignty in a case out of Georgia, writing that the tribes were “distinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights.”
The ruling infuriated Jackson. To him, Indians were “a few savage hunters” who should yield their land to white Christians. The Supreme Court decision, he wrote, was “stillborn,” because they “cannot coerce Georgia to yield to its mandate.” In other words: How many troops does the Supreme Court have? The court order was never enforced. And not long after Jackson’s second term ended, most Indians had been removed from their ancient tribal homelands in the American South.
This history is haunting. Among the many things that keep people awake at night is a vision of a tyrannical Trump openly defying the Constitution. Because he has yet to fully untangle himself from his many personal holdings, he is already being sued for violation of the emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from receiving money or gifts from foreign governments.
But that’s a trifle compared to what an enraged Trump could do if the courts try to stop him on the Muslim ban. Don’t count on Republicans, who waved their pocket copies of the Constitution at the most inconsequential executive orders of President Obama, to come to the rescue. Their patriotism is entirely situational.
The fate of the republic may hinge on how much Trump decides to emulate the slaveholding, Indian-hating, Constitution-violating man staring at him from that portrait in the Oval Office. Jackson is too close for comfort.",negative
26,"And their policies often become harsher as well as broader, Mr. van der Maat said, as leaders climb what he called “the ladder of violence” — moving from discrimination into more significant persecution.
Large-scale deportations, such as those Mr. Trump promised on the campaign trail, would be a step higher on that ladder, Mr. Van der Maat said, because they would require the use of force and affect a wide segment of the population. The president last week signed an executive order that would give law enforcement officials expanded resources for carrying out deportations, and promised to punish “sanctuary cities” that refuse to cooperate with federal deportation efforts.
Testing the limits of power
Mr. Trump is a democratically elected president, and the United States is a democracy. But the experts caution that does not mean that the lessons of authoritarian behavior should be ignored entirely.
Presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Weiler said, were democratically elected, then systematically undermined democratic checks and balances to consolidate their own power.
Leaders with authoritarian tendencies “will push and push until they find a spot where they can’t push anymore — and if they don’t, they’ll keep going,” Ms. Berman said. “We’re watching that process happen in not-so-slow motion in Turkey now,” she said, where Mr. Erdogan has “eroded the democratic system to the point where most analysts think it’s no longer democratic at all.”
Mr. Trump’s refugee ban, if it is found to be legal, is not necessarily a step toward that kind of democratic decline, Ms. Berman said. The key thing to watch for, she said, is whether he will try to use the power of the presidency to push through illegal rules or overrule checks and balances.
That has not yet occurred. But the ban is a sign that Mr. Trump is willing to push the limits of the norms of American governing. By circumventing normal procedures for drafting and issuing executive orders, the White House created confusion and chaos within the agencies that will enforce the new rules. On Monday, Acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates said she did not think the ban was legal and directed the Justice Department not to defend it. Mr. Trump fired her later that day.",negative
27,"Democrats, meanwhile, were bitterly remembering that last year Barack Obama had nominated an intelligent, well-spoken moderate moderate in the form of Judge Merrick Garland. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn’t even hold a hearing. Now Trump was expecting them to roll out the welcome mat for his guy.
What to do? The Democrats could filibuster, but then McConnell might try to change the rules so it would only take a simple majority to push a Supreme Court nominee through. This is known as the “nuclear option,” a colorful but rather unnerving nickname now that we’ve got President Trump speaking so enthusiastically about going nuclear.
The Gorsuch nomination is important, but there could be an even more critical one later if either Justice Anthony Kennedy or Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the court. Kennedy is 80 and Ginsburg turns 84 next month. She once told me that she does the Canadian Air Force stretching and warming exercises almost every day at home, along with a more strenuous workout with a trainer twice a week. Close your eye and say a prayer for the Canadian Air Force.
Meanwhile, about Gorsuch. Do you think the Democrats should:
A) Fight! Fight! Fight!
B) Save their ammunition. Things are just going to get worse.
C) I don’t want to talk about it. I’m going to crawl back under the bed.
I’m sorry, you cannot pick C. We’ve had the discussion about not crawling under the bed many times already. A lot of people are probably going to go for A, given the Trump administration’s genius for generating fear and loathing. The other day I attempted to blot out the world by playing an online game called Two Dots, which is exactly as profound as it sounds. But instead of the dots, I got an announcement asking me to support the American Civil Liberties Union.",neutral

The new settlement announcements could help ease the pressure on Mr. Netanyahu, who is under investigation on several fronts and is trying to push back against politicians further to the right. The education minister, Naftali Bennett, is pressing for legislation — not yet fully embraced by Mr. Netanyahu — to take the drastic step of the first annexation of a West Bank settlement, Ma’ale Adumim, just east of Jerusalem.
Speaking in the Parliament on Wednesday as the outpost evacuation began, Mr. Bennett said of Amona, “We lost the battle, but we are winning the campaign for the land of Israel.”
Mr. Netanyahu is also now pushing for the contentious legislation that would retroactively legalize the illegal outposts, although he originally opposed it. Israel’s attorney general has said that the bill is unconstitutional and contravenes international law, and that he would refuse to defend any challenges in court.

29,"We wrote this together because we have a few things in common. Some are obvious: Both of us came to the United States as teenagers fleeing Communist regimes; both of us are queer.

One thing that we share is less obvious: This anger and despair make both of us feel as if we are losing our home.
Masha once spent an evening in Berlin with a sociologist and a philosopher trying to define “home.” The three discussants had, among them, lived in more than half a dozen countries and counted themselves native in at least two languages each. Facts like country of birth, length of stay or mother tongue were not applicable. Other descriptors emerged: a sense of safety, a sense of familiarity, a sense of inhabiting space with certainty, a sense, indeed, of the certainty of that space — the opposite feeling of having the rug pulled out from under your feet.
President Trump has introduced fear into our households. Both of us are married to women who are not American citizens (both are Russians who carry green cards), and both of us are raising children some of whom are United States citizens and some not. Most Americans do not realize that a hierarchy of immigrant security exists. Permanent green-card holders are more secure than provisional ones; political asylum or refugee status can be canceled with the stroke of a pen; asylum applicants are the most vulnerable — thousands of people are in the country legally, awaiting an interview or a decision on their application, but their right to remain here can be snatched away for any reason. Many of these people would face violence or even death if they were forced to return to their countries. In this hierarchy, our partners and children are safer than most, but a sense of insecurity has still seeped into our homes — making them feel less like home.

A few months earlier, the Czechoslovak authorities had denied her permission to travel to the U.S. Open. They later reversed that decision, but the experience of powerlessness was enough to make her seek political asylum when she got to New York.

30,"“This is an important process that the acting secretary, and the department as a whole, respect and value,” said a spokesman, Mark Toner.
The speed with which the memo was assembled and the number of signers underscore the degree to which the State Department has become a center of the resistance to Mr. Trump’s order. More broadly, it represents objections to his efforts to cut back on American participation in international organizations and to issue ultimatums to allies.
Not surprisingly, the diplomats and Civil Service officers of the State Department are among the most internationally minded in the government; they have lived around the world and devoted their careers to building alliances and promoting American values abroad.
That was reflected in parts of the draft of the dissent memo circulating in the State Department. It warned that the executive order “will increase anti-American sentiment,” and that “instead of building bridges to these societies,” it would “send the message that we consider all nationals of these countries to be an unacceptable security risk.”
Among those whose views will be changed are “current and future leaders in these societies — including those for whom this may be a tipping point toward radicalization.” It also warned of an immediate humanitarian effect on those who come “to seek medical treatment for a child with a rare heart condition, to attend a parent’s funeral.”
“We do not need to alienate entire societies to stay safe,” the memo concludes.
Overseas, Iraqi officials said they were surprised by the directive, which they learned about through the American news media; they had not been consulted first. Objections from Baghdad are notable since Iraq is a front-line partner in the campaign against the Islamic State.

31,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Trump assured South Korea’s acting president on Monday of the United States’ “ironclad” commitment to defend the country, agreeing with Seoul to strengthen joint defense capabilities against North Korea.
Mr. Trump’s assurances came amid anxiety in South Korea over the future of the alliance with the United States. During his campaign, Mr. Trump cast some doubt on the United States’ defense and trade commitments, saying that South Korea was not paying enough to help keep 28,500 American troops in the country.
But speaking by phone to Hwang Kyo-ahn, the acting president of South Korea, Mr. Trump said that the coming visit to South Korea by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis reflected the close friendship of the two countries and the importance of their alliance. Mr. Mattis is scheduled to visit South Korea on Thursday on his first official trip abroad, which also includes a stop in Japan.
“President Trump reiterated our ironclad commitment to defend the R.O.K., including through the provision of extended deterrence, using the full range of military capabilities,” the White House said in a statement after Mr. Trump’s phone conversation with Mr. Hwang, using the initials for South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.",neutral
32,"To the Editor:
Several recent articles, including Paul Krugman’s Jan. 23 column, “Things Can Only Get Worse,” emphasize Donald Trump’s bleak characterization of America, but don’t point out the real reason for it.
President Trump’s dystopian Inaugural Address describing “American carnage” was a set piece that began a predefined evolution of his rhetoric. This is part of the Art of the Scam: Denigrate and disparage the country now so that he, and he alone, can take credit for transforming it.
Within two years he will be emphasizing how much things have improved; in four years we can safely predict that he will be speaking of the greatness that he has wrought. This will all be independent of any objective evidence of tangible improvements for Americans.
Donald Trump has taken over a country that is already great. As this inevitable morphing of rhetoric takes place, we need to hold him and the Republicans accountable, not be deluded by words.",positive
33,"American officials and analysts said the Qaeda leader who was believed to have been killed was Abdulrauf al Dhahab.
The raid took place in Yemen around the time that Mr. Trump was signing a directive in Washington on Saturday afternoon ordering Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to devise within 30 days a more aggressive plan to defeat the Islamic State.
The Islamic State was born from Al Qaeda’s branch in Iraq, but the two terrorist organizations are now sworn rivals not only in Iraq and Syria, but also in other hot spots like Yemen and Afghanistan, where both groups have affiliates.
Because Mr. Trump had been explicit about his intention to ask for the review to accelerate the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, American military planners had begun drafting classified options to present to the new commander in chief. Some of those options, like pushing more authority to conduct strikes to commanders in the field or loosening restrictions designed to limit the risk to civilians, could also be applied to attacks against Qaeda fighters and Islamic State insurgents.
There were no immediate indications that the rules of engagement had been loosened for the mission in Yemen, military officials said. The Central Command’s statement did not elaborate on details of the raid or identify the commando who was killed.
A local resident who witnessed the raid, speaking by phone, said he had seen warplanes bombing several houses in the village around 2 a.m. Sunday. The man said he had seen at least three buildings being struck before he fled. He did not want to be identified because he feared that speaking out would endanger his life.
A Yemeni government official in Bayda Province said the targeted buildings belonged to the Dhahab family, which is known for its ties to Al Qaeda. Two male members of the family have been killed in drone strikes over the past two years.",negative
34,"WASHINGTON — Travelers were stranded around the world, protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump’s party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration.
The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump’s temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States. By the end of the day, the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order.
But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president’s order as a retreat from traditional American values. European leaders denounced the order, and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down. As of Sunday evening, officials said no one was being held at American airports, although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained.
More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office, the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building. It has thrust the nine-day-old administration into its first constitutional conflict, as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order, and into its broadest diplomatic incident, with overseas allies objecting.",negative
35,"Known for its shock of yellow hair and bright orange cheeks, the lesser prairie-chicken once roamed the Great Plains. Today, though, the grouse is under threat — its populations reduced to isolated pockets in western Kansas, Colorado and the Texas-New Mexico border as its habitat succumbs to climate-induced drought, farming, drilling and other human activity.
The group has been petitioning the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The bird found itself taken off the list after a lawsuit in 2014 backed by the oil and gas industry, which argues that any protective measures would mean added costs for energy developers.
Mr. Salvo has found that to gain allies it doesn’t always help to start with the role climate change plays in harming the bird’s habitat. Instead, his movement has tried to find common ground, highlighting the historical heritage of the lesser prairie-chicken. In the “Little House on the Prairie” novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about eating prairie-chicken mush.
Mr. Salvo also stresses how grouse-friendly practices can be good for farming, too, backing a federal program that provides financial aid to private landowners who adopt those practices. Leaving corn stubble standing after harvest gives the birds food and places to hide, for example, while also helping farmers protect the soil.
“Sometimes, to gain allies, it helps to focus on issues of common concern, to support local economic development as well as species conservation,” he said. “It helps everybody come to the table.”
Last week, Mr. Palen, the farmer, was again talking weather — if not climate change — at a conference of no-till farmers in Salina, Kan. Sessions included “Using Your Water Efficiently,” “Making Weather Work for You in 2017” and “Building Healthy Soil With Mob Grazing,” a practice that helps to fertilize the land.
And yes, Mr. Palen says, he is on board with saving the lesser prairie-chicken. “I often think of ways I can protect their habitat,” he said. “I enjoy wildlife.”",negative
36,"Should we journalists use the word “lie” to describe President Trump’s most manifest falsehoods?
That debate has roiled the news world. The Times this week used the word “lie” in a front-page headline, and I agreed with that decision, but there’s a counterargument that lying requires an intention to deceive — and that Trump may actually believe his absurd falsehoods.
So in 2017 we reach a mortifying moment for a great democracy: We must decide whether our 45th president is a liar or a crackpot.
Yet the costliest presidential falsehoods and delusions are not the ones that people are talking about, such as those concerning the inauguration crowd or electoral fraud. The most horrific chicanery involves Trump’s new actions on women’s health that will cause deaths around the globe.

Great wealth should certainly be no bar to public service, nor should it necessarily be a qualification. In her Senate hearing, Ms. DeVos seemed bewildered by questions about public education policy, philosophy and law.

41,"Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to conclude that all expressions of contempt are equally bad. Contempt occurs in the context of social relationships that are themselves characterized by power differences. Those power differences have a profound effect on the shape of contempt and its effectiveness in diminishing the agency of its target. A contemptuous protest sign directed at the president is not on par with a contemptuous remark made by that president.
As every adolescent knows, certain people wield much greater social power than others. The source of that power in middle school may be mysterious, but the effects of it are obvious enough. A suitably socially positioned 12-year-old has the power to make a classmate persona non grata.
Adult relationships are less obviously, but equally, characterized by social power differentials, and we ignore these at our peril. Some people are well situated to dehumanize others; some people are more vulnerable to dehumanization than others. This means that not all contempt is the same. Contempt expressed by the socially powerful toward the socially vulnerable is a much greater moral danger than contempt that flows in the opposite direction. As president, Trump occupies a position of exceptional social power. Contempt bolstered by such power becomes far more effective and hence, far more threatening to our grounding democratic values.
Trump is broad-minded about the targets of his contempt; just about anyone who criticizes him seems to be fair game. Nevertheless, his tendency to treat members of much less powerful social groups with contempt is particularly troubling. Trump’s imitation of Kovaleski reinforced a specific social inequality that most people now recognize as morally abhorrent; namely, the marginalization of people with disabilities. In characterizing Mexicans as rapists and women as objects of sexual gratification, he has engaged in the same kind of marginalization.
Trump’s standard method of responding to critics includes denigrating their appearance, denying their intelligence and calling them total failures. He thus treats them as objects to be scorned and dismissed, rather than as fellow human beings worthy of basic respect. This is what makes it contempt and not merely colorfully expressed criticism.
It may seem as though the best response to Trump’s contempt is to return it in kind, treating him the same way he treats others. The trouble, though, is that contempt toward Trump does not function in the same way that his contempt toward others functions. Even if we grant that Trump deserves contempt for his attitudes and behaviors, his powerful social position insulates him from the worst of contempt’s effects. It is simply not possible to disregard or diminish the agency of the president of the United States. This means that contempt is not a particularly useful weapon in the battle against bigotry or misogyny. The socially vulnerable cannot wield it effectively precisely because of their social vulnerability.",neutral

43,"The high-risk programs offered a separate insurance pool for people with potentially expensive medical conditions. The idea is that by separating sick people from the majority of people who are healthy, insurers could offer cheaper rates to the healthy people. Insurers could charge higher prices to those with existing medical conditions, but they would also rely on other sources of funding, including from the government, to cover their costs.
The system worked for Dan Nassimbene and his wife, who had breast cancer but is in remission. They enrolled in Colorado’s high-risk pool for three years. She paid about $375 a month for a plan that covered most of her treatments.
In 2014, though, the high-risk pool was closed, and Mr. Nassimbene bought a plan that met the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The cheapest plan he could buy for himself and his wife cost around $900 a month and came with a family deductible of around $12,000, much higher than it was before. His income was too high for him to receive any government subsidies, which help about 80 percent of people buying such plans.
“I had coverage but no access,” said Mr. Nassimbene, 55. He has since switched to a Christian health care sharing ministry, in which members cover one another’s medical bills. It does not qualify as coverage under the law.
In many cases, the high-risk pools were overburdened financially, leaving many people without insurance or with tight restrictions on coverage. Insurers refused to cover the individuals who were likely to have the highest expenses, like those who had H.I.V. or serious kidney disease, and the pools lost money.
Many states had to turn applicants away — in some states, only a small percentage of those who applied received coverage — and the insurance was sharply limited to control spending.",negative

In his first speech as president of the United States, Donald J. Trump showed the world he could be as divisive abroad as he is at home. His vow to place America first — and his threat to upend longstanding alliances, trade deals and many other tenets of the liberal democratic order the nation has chosen for nearly 70 years — was received across the globe with fear, silence and glee, sometimes within the same country.
In searching for a historical analogy, some in Britain reached back to the 1930s, when a bleaker vision of the world prevailed with America on the sidelines. China imposed unusually tight state control over coverage of the inaugural, though state media highlighted “violent” protests in the United States. In the Philippines, nationalists set fire to an effigy of Mr. Trump, while the country’s president welcomed his American counterpart’s apparent willingness to stop telling other leaders how to govern.
In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May said she would tell a skeptical Mr. Trump how important NATO and the European Union are for European and world stability. “With the threats we face, it’s not the time for less cooperation,” Mrs. May, who is supposed to travel to Washington soon, told The Financial Times.",negative
46,"“These stories give readers permission to think about what it would be like to wake up as another gender or another race,” Mr. Cooper said. The work is a plea for empathy, he added, “an investigation of what it might mean literally to step into the shoes of another.”
One may learn, as Drew does, that being pretty and popular is no shield against the envy or predations of her nastier peers. One may encounter, with Oryon, the reserves of fear and bias that are only partly concealed by a veil of civility.
Oryon is compelled to sit in the school lunchroom exclusively with other black students and endure racial profiling at the hands of the local police; he is roughed up by members of a faction known as the Abiders, self-appointed keepers of the status quo. “If you learn anything as a Changer,” he observes in “Book Two,” “it’s that all the supposedly bygone stereotypes and prejudices are far from bygone.”
For Mr. Cooper, the book provides an opportunity as well to sort out and clear up misconceptions about what it is to be transgender. “That doesn’t entail just a change of name or surgery or clothes or haircut,” he said. “For so many people it is hard to understand that a man can be attracted to women but then also feel like a woman. Once he transitions into a female, that doesn’t mean he suddenly wants to be with men.”
That observation is reflected throughout the series. “Somebody who has to live through four different iterations,” Mr. Cooper said, “learns that gender doesn’t really affect what or whom he’s drawn to.”
Each book is a probe into effects of gender, race and body image on the formation of identity. Those externals, along with the experiences accrued in a lifetime, do little to alter that immutable bedrock known as character, the authors argue. “Each of the books is a meditation on the essentialness of humans,” Mr. Cooper said.",negative
47,"“Hail to the Chief” is perhaps one of the most recognizable musical pieces associated with the United States presidency. The stately song has been played at events attended by presidents for more than a century.
It made an appearance again on Friday, when the United States Marine Band played at the inauguration in Washington, signifying the transfer of power from President Obama to Donald J. Trump.
Here’s a brief history of the tune, including the time one president shunned it.
The inaugural ceremony
The Marine Band, established in 1798 to provide ceremonial music for the president, started playing “Hail to the Chief” in the 19th century. It has been used most commonly to announce the arrival of American leaders, like when they enter a room for a ceremonial dinner. It has also been played to introduce a new commander in chief.",negative

50,"On the streets outside the security perimeter, protesters raged. But within the border, where school groups and bleary-eyed travelers watched the proceedings on Jumbotrons, one would scarcely have known of the opposition.
Washington became a microcosm of the unusual mixture of Americans who helped Donald J. Trump win the presidency. They came from the nearby suburbs, from the country’s moneyed enclaves and from rural communities in every direction. If the crowd was smaller than those in years past, it did not seem to bother anyone.
When Mr. Trump finally appeared on the West Front of the Capitol, a crowd that had been impatiently awaiting his arrival let forth with approval. When he spoke of “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you the people,” they knew it had been worth the wait.
“Politicians take us for granted,” Coleman Sellers, 29, of Vienna, Va., had said an hour or so earlier. “They say give us your vote, and then it’s, ‘I’m smarter than you,’” He added, “Well, no, you’re not. I can read. I can see what’s going on in the world.”",neutral
51,"“They’re kind of like the moon,” said Walter Russell Mead, a professor at Bard College and a scholar at the Hudson Institute who has written extensively about Jackson’s influence. “They’re the brightest object in the night sky when the moon is full, but they wax and wane.”
On Friday, Mr. Trump’s moon was full. He dispensed with the usual grace notes of inaugural speeches, not even mentioning or shaking the hand of his vanquished opponent, Mrs. Clinton, who sat watching with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. (Mr. Trump did recognize the Clintons at a lunch at the Capitol after the ceremony.) While he thanked former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, for their “gracious aid” during the transition, he described the country Mr. Obama left behind as a Mad Max-like dystopia.
Using ominous language reminiscent of his speech at the Republican National Convention, Mr. Trump talked about “mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities,” “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation,” schools that teach students nothing, and “the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.”
Lest Republicans become complacent, Mr. Trump made it clear that he believes he is leading a populist movement that has little regard for any party platforms or loyalties. He thundered against free trade, a pillar of the Republican Party, as he did during the campaign.
He promised a Franklin D. Roosevelt-style public works campaign — “new roads and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways” — something the Republicans would have implacably opposed had it come from Mrs. Clinton.",negative
52,"“We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,” he said. “The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.”
Mr. Trump’s view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address — a country where mothers and children are “trapped in poverty in our inner cities,” where “rusted-out factories” are “scattered like tombstones across the landscape” and where drugs and crime “have stolen too many lives.”
“This American carnage,” he declared, “stops right here and stops right now.”
He got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to “ease the burden” of the Affordable Care Act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law. More orders are planned for next week.
Wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife, Melania, in a powder-blue suit and matching gloves, Mr. Trump took the 35-word oath administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. precisely at noon. Michael Richard Pence, a former governor and congressman from Indiana, was sworn in minutes before as vice president by Justice Clarence Thomas.",negative
53,"Aside from the occasional appearance at a Broadway show or walk in the woods around her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., Mrs. Clinton has kept a low profile since her election loss in November. As her husband and daughter, Chelsea Clinton, dive into their efforts at the Clinton Foundation, Mrs. Clinton has given no signal about what she will do next. “She’s just not there yet,” said a friend who talked to her recently.
Asked how she’s doing, Mrs. Clinton has told friends that she is “surviving,” said several people who have spoken with her but would describe the content of the private conversations only on the condition of anonymity.
Mrs. Clinton has pointed to the decision by the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to release a letter related to her private email server days before the election and to the Russian government’s cyberattacks on Democratic targets as the reasons for her defeat.
In December, at an event in Manhattan to thank her top donors, Mrs. Clinton said the hacking attacks carried out by Russia were intended “to undermine our democracy” and were ordered by President Vladimir V. Putin “because he has a personal beef against me.”
Just as her candidacy divided many women, Mrs. Clinton’s attendance at the inauguration prompted mixed reactions.
To some, her presence was a reminder of the missteps of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign in a race that many Democrats considered hers to lose. Half a dozen elected officials who campaigned aggressively for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment when asked about her attendance on Friday.",neutral
54,"While at odds with most economic assessments, Mr. Trump’s words find an audience in places that have been left behind.
“President Trump made it clear that he understands that, despite a declining federal unemployment rate and a rising stock market, there are certain industries and communities that are still struggling,” said M. Robert Weidner III, chief executive of the Metals Service Center Institute, a trade group for producers and distributors of industrial metals.
“I’m more hopeful today than I have been in a long time,” Mr. Weidner added.
But it is a misleading diagnosis of the reasons for the decline of factory work.
There were more than 17 million factory workers in the United States two decades ago; now there are slightly more than 12 million. Some kinds of manufacturing, like textiles and furniture, have largely disappeared. And increased foreign trade did play a role in the decline.
But most economists agree that technological progress is the primary cause. The value of America’s industrial output is at the highest level in history, but those goods are produced by fewer workers, a trend that cannot be reversed by changes in trade policy.
Moreover, the broader economy is showing new signs of vitality. Economic growth since the recession has been modest at best, and during most of President Obama’s tenure, the gains accrued mostly to the wealthy. Corporations posted record profits while wages stagnated. But those trends began to shift during the second half of Mr. Obama’s second term.
The private sector added jobs in each of the last 74 months, a record that lowered the unemployment rate to 4.7 percent in December. Crucially, those gains are finally starting to lift middle-class incomes. The median household income increased by 5.2 percent in 2015, the largest single-year increase since record-keeping began in 1967. Economists estimate that median household income rose again in 2016. Official data will be released later this year.",negative

Gone were the screaming graphics, countdown clocks, and endless crawl of headlines. Why compete with the sheer drama of what was unfolding in real time on screen: the oath of President Donald J. Trump?
“If we go silent from time to time, we’re just doing what you’re doing,” Brian Williams, leading the coverage on MSNBC, told viewers on Friday morning. “It’s a lot to take in.”
But if cable news was relatively predictable in its tonal divides — MSNBC remarking, again and again, on the lackluster size of the crowd; Fox News airing a rah-rah video about Mr. Trump’s victory with a patriotic soundtrack — the major networks were remarkably united in their astonishment at the president’s unorthodox address.",negative

57,"The public editor’s take: I side with the readers on this one. It’s true that the article mentioned — well into the story — that households overall purchase about the same amount of sweetened drinks as SNAP households, but that wasn’t the way the story was framed. Furthermore, headlines matter, and this one said: “In the Shopping Cart of a Food Stamp Household: Lots of Soda.” That’s fairly loaded. And then there was that photograph of a shopping cart filled almost entirely with soda. (In fact, the story noted, 5 percent of the SNAP dollars spent on food goes to soft drinks.) The cutline under the photo? “A government report shows that sugary soda is the most popular item in the shopping carts of families that receive federal food stamps.” The purchases of food stamp households is a long-debated subject in political and policy circles. This piece didn’t do much to advance the discussion.
Staying on the popular topic of health, several readers took issue with The Times referring to the Affordable Care Act as Obamacare, arguing that the issue is too fraught to attach Obama’s name to the law.
Referring to the Affordable Care Act as Obamacare plays into the hands of the conservative right who have weaponized that shorthand label. (Remember Hillarycare?) Only using the health care law’s rightful name is a small but responsible journalistic response to the current Republican assault. Harriet Watson, Portland, Ore.
There has been vacillation, however, over what to call the act, often among Democrats themselves, depending on its popularity. In 2013, President Obama affirmed he wanted the law to be referred to by his name. “We passed Obamacare — yes, I like the term — we passed it because I do care, and I want to put these choices in your hands where they belong,” he said.
We asked Phil Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, for his take.
Most often in straight news stories we refer to the law by its formal name, the Affordable Care Act, or simply with a generic description like “President Obama’s health-care law.” Early on, we studiously avoided “Obamacare” because it was used primarily as a derogatory name, by critics, and seemed politically loaded to us. I think that “loaded” quality has long since faded, since people on all sides of the debate now routinely use the nickname “Obamacare.” We still generally avoid it in straight-news stories from Washington, because we generally don’t use a lot of nicknames or colloquial terms in those stories. But The Upshot has always adopted a more informal, conversational tone, so we decided a long time ago that “Obamacare” was O.K. in that context.
One story on Obamacare caught readers’ attention on account of its headline, which read: “Trump Promises ‘Insurance for Everybody’ as Health Law Replacement.”
I was dismayed to see the uncritical headline. Not until the fourth paragraph does the article mention that he offered absolutely no details for this plan. I see this kind of headline as a gift to the president-elect, allowing him to broadcast vague promises without accountability. Please don’t make it so easy for Trump to manipulate the media. Jenny Davis, Belfast, Me.
With Donald Trump’s inauguration taking place today, it’s as good a time as any to remind journalists to stay vigilant in holding him accountable.
Another reader noted that the reporting on Volkswagen’s diesel scandal could use a deeper look in one area.
I am writing about the coverage of the Volkswagen diesel scandal and settlement. Jack Ewing and Neal Boudette have done some good reporting, especially on the criminal aspects of this case. But what I find lacking is any coverage — and, indeed, investigation — into the progress of the buyback program for those of us who are personally impacted by this scandal. I am the owner of a 2013 VW Passat TDI and a verified claimant in the litigation who has chosen to have VW buyback my vehicle. The court settlement was reached on October 18 and we were promised a quick turnaround, within weeks, to receive our buyback. Two months have passed and we have heard nothing, let alone received our settlement money. Calling the “VW Claimant Line” to get information is an exercise in frustration. After several calls recently I finally spoke with a representative who confessed that they are way behind schedule. I and others want to know what is going on. We have little recourse to complain and no media outlet seems to be investigating this delay. The Rev. Dr. Scott P. Albergate, Havertown, Pa.
After we passed the note along to one of those reporters, Ewing, The Times’s European economics correspondent, he told us that this is indeed something the paper should be writing about. He also said:
The Volkswagen case has generated a lot of mail and often tells me something I didn’t know. It was through readers early in the case that I realized how effectively Volkswagen sold to environmentally conscious buyers, who were then extra mad to learn about the cheating. More recently I’ve gotten a few letters from people having problems with the buyback process, although others have told me it’s going well. As always there is an issue of reporter bandwidth.
Finally, The Times has found some closure with respect to the new first lady’s courtesy title. Last July, the public editor addressed why some women are referred to as “Ms.,” including Melania Trump, and some as “Mrs.” The public editor noted that Melania Trump had “yet to express a preference (thus the default ‘Ms.,’ although reporters have been asked to determine her preference).”
Now, however, the senior editor for standards, Greg Brock, tells the newsroom that the next first lady has expressed a preference: henceforth she will be referred to as Mrs. Trump in The Times’s pages.",negative
58,"To the Editor:
It was troubling to watch President Trump’s Inaugural Address, which was more about what is wrong with America instead of what is right. Mr. Trump will soon realize that to be a good president, you need a unifying message so that Americans from across the political spectrum will get behind you. He hasn’t demonstrated he is capable of doing that.
Now that he is in the awesomely powerful office of the presidency, I hope that such a needed behavior change will occur so he can govern effectively.

It is often said that politics is a pendulum that swings both ways. As the country turns in a new and, very possibly, dangerous direction, I cannot say that I’m optimistic about the new administration taking the reins of government.

60,"When I was in elementary school, I had recurring nightmares about the Holocaust. A certainty hung around me like heavy, dust-filmed drapes — a conviction that it not only could happen again but would. I couldn’t focus on multiplication problems or long division. I was too busy figuring out where I might hide when they came for me.
This would seem like psychopathology were it not for several factors.
My dad, a history buff fascinated by my mother’s Eastern European Jewish ancestry, had been overzealous in educating me about the Holocaust. I visited Yad Vashem, Israel’s official memorial to Holocaust victims, as a 7-year-old. I knew about the yellow stars, broken glass, the children torn screaming from their mothers.
I was not raised Jewish, but as an evangelical Christian. My mom converted to Christianity when she was 16; my dad, a Catholic, became a Baptist in his early 20s and eventually a Baptist pastor.
Still, it was important to my father that I knew I was Jewish; he spent his lunch hours at the Brooklyn Public Library learning Yiddish folk songs, which he taught me to sing. He taught me to say the Shema — the prayer that’s at the center of Jewish daily worship — in Hebrew. All highly unusual for an evangelical child, I need hardly say.",negative

Many other national security positions remain unfilled, and it’s unclear how much if any of the briefing materials prepared by the outgoing administration have even been read.

62,"When I met Ms. Raymond-Tolan she was overseeing a group that met weekly to pursue this vein of dissent, and persuade friends and relatives in other states — Maine, New Jersey, Wisconsin — to take the same measures with their own representatives. No staff member for a member of Congress representing an exurb in Wisconsin wants to hear from an orthodontist in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, about what’s wrong with Rex Tillerson, Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of state. (Other groups meeting in the same synagogue that evening as part of the Get Organized BK movement, and spilling out of the rooms in which they had been assigned, were targeting women’s health initiatives, or working to develop projects to help schools expand student activism, or talking about how to hold the news media accountable for its coverage of the Trump presidency.) Ms. Raymond-Tolan’s group had already delivered over 2,500 letters to the offices of Senators Kirsten E. Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer, Democrats of New York, asking that they obstruct Mr. Trump’s cabinet appointments.
Outside Mr. Schumer’s prewar building on Prospect Park West in Brooklyn, there have been two actions this month in which hundreds of ordinary people convened, letting the senator, who is the minority leader, know that they are keeping watch, and, by implication, that they will work to install some other Democrat in his place if he concedes, or gets lazy.
Despite the city’s long history of radicalism — during the Progressive movement of the 19th century, in the Communist fervor leading up to World War I, or the social upheavals of the 1960s and ’70s — there is always a strain of skepticism that greets the expression of certain political ideals. Cynicism animates the city as much as hope and conviction. To what extent are activists engaging in self-soothing? To what extent are they merely trying to establish their own relevance? It is always tempting to see the absurdity in theatrical gestures. One woman I met, who had been part of a group devising possible boycotts, announced that the group had come up with the idea of a Dump Trump event. A trash bin would be placed in Grand Army Plaza, in the heart of Park Slope, where people could dispose of their Trump merchandise — shoes by Ivanka, say — which accumulate in brownstone Brooklyn the way collected volumes by Max Weber pile up at Disney World.",negative

Mr. Farage, the former head of the United Kingdom Independence Party, is one of Europe’s leading proponents of nationalism, and his appointment comes at the start of a year of critical elections in Europe, where right-wing groups are mounting significant bids for power.
It also showcases the extent to which Fox News has become a friendly venue for Mr. Trump and his circle, with stars like Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly offering daily affirmations of the new president.

WASHINGTON, 7:53 p.m.: Downtown is almost totally paralyzed with traffic. The Escalade is blocks away from its destination, the Hotel Harrington. But because multiple roads are blocked, no one is sure how to get there, and no one on the street, when asked, is particularly willing to help. There is ululating and the pounding of drums in the distance: protesters, apparently.
“What’s their day job, protesting?” Morgan says.

It owns the building that houses Mr. Trump’s hotel and has granted him a 60-year lease.

There’s a lot of debate over whether it is demeaning to discuss what a first lady and president wear; whether it takes valuable time away from serious issues. I would never put clothes on the same level as the myriad crucial issues facing a president every day, like taxes, international relations and climate change. But you can’t ignore the fact that in an increasingly visual world, there is an the opportunity to underscore an impression or a message via clothing, to connect all those people watching with the one normal thing that happens during that whole singular ceremony (we all have to get dressed), so why wouldn’t you exploit that?
I once asked a friend who was a crisis consultant for global leaders whether presidents really spent as much time and thought on a tie as I thought they did, and he said, “You have no idea.” And if they spend that much time on a tie, imagine how much time and thought the first lady and her team spend on a dress seen around the world.
Just because something seems frivolous or trivial does not mean it is not an effective tool. Of course, some politicians and their partners understand this better than others. And it’s fine if you just wear something that looks nice. Though it does seem like a wasted opportunity.
Can it really make a difference?

72,"The regulator accuses Navient, the former Sallie Mae operation that services $315 billion worth of loans, of defrauding borrowers by giving them bad information and obscuring their ability to take advantage of federal programs that tie repayments to income. It further says the $4.6 billion company steered struggling customers to seek temporary forbearance rather than federal assistance, causing them to rack up $4 billion in extra interest charges.
Banks ultimately paid tens of billions of dollars to settle allegations of mortgage-lending abuses. Navient is taking a tougher approach. It rejected the charges as unfounded and political, noting how the timing of the lawsuit coincides with political regime change. It is betting on more favorable treatment under the new administration. The C.F.P.B., a Dodd-Frank creation, is disliked by congressional Republicans and the financial-services industry alike.

Now he is widely expected to become the director of the National Development and Reform Commission, a powerful agency where he is currently a deputy director. That promotion would increase his visibility as well as his prospects of becoming a deputy prime minister in 2018, when a new government is formed for Mr. Xi’s second term.
Mr. Liu cannot dictate policy unilaterally, but his proximity to Mr. Xi gives him more sway than his bureaucratic-sounding titles would suggest.

Johnson, a senior China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “He has shifted from a stance earlier on when he was very careful not to demonstrate the level of influence he had.”
Beside pressing for a dose of economic liberalization and more room for markets, he has advocated trimming bloated state-owned industry and sought to curtail China’s ever-rising debt.
But even as he has gained influence, his ability to push through changes in these areas has been limited. Mr. Xi still calls the shots, and his pledge to revamp the economy jostles alongside his fiercely conservative agenda to restore party control and protect state companies. Mr. Xi’s promises of shaking up industry and reducing debt clash with vows to keep growth ticking.",negative
74,"President-elect will say so long to Trump Force One
Wednesday night will be Mr. Trump’s last ride on his favorite accessory: his blue-and-gold-painted airplane, with his name across the side.
Mr. Trump will return to Washington briefly on Wednesday evening, but will not spend the night. Instead, he will return to New York City for a final stay at Trump Tower before he is sworn in on Friday.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump will be escorted to Washington on a military jet, according to a person briefed on the plans. He will spend that night at Blair House, the president’s guesthouse.
The Secret Service insists for security reasons that the president travel on the official aircraft.
At first glance, Air Force One is an indisputable status symbol for an incoming president who focuses heavily on aesthetics. But Air Force One does not have the gold-plated belt buckles or wood tables that Trump Force One does.
And Mr. Trump is also happiest with things that are familiar, and that he himself owns. He spent most of his campaign with his airplane as his mobile headquarters, writing speeches and giving interviews from his seat. He is one of the only incoming presidents to whom Air Force One might feel like a step down.
Despite Obama’s efforts, a Muslim registry could be revived
Warily looking at the incoming Trump administration, President Obama moved in recent weeks to eliminate all vestiges of a program created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, that required men from countries with active terrorist groups to provide their fingerprints and to register with the federal government.",negative
75,"In any case, the relevant legislation gives the occupant of the White House remarkable leeway should he choose to go protectionist. He can restrict imports if such imports “threaten to impair the national security”; he can impose tariffs “to deal with large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits”; he can modify tariff rates when foreign governments engage in “unjustifiable” policies. Who determines whether such conditions apply? The executive himself.

Now, these provisions weren’t intended to empower a president to reverse decades of U.S. trade policy, or engage in personal vendettas. You can guess, however, how much such niceties are likely to bother the incoming administration, which is already talking about using its powers. Which brings us to the question of motive.
Why would a Trump administration impose restrictions on imports? One answer is those working-class voters, whose supposed champion is set to pursue a radically antiworker domestic agenda. There’s an obvious incentive for Mr. Trump to make a big show of doing something to fulfill campaign promises. And if this creates international conflict, that’s actually a plus when it comes to diverting attention from collapsing health care and so on.
Beyond this, it’s clear that the incoming commander-in-chief really believes that international trade is a game in which nice guys finish last, and that America has been taken advantage of. Furthermore, he’s picking advisers who will confirm him in these beliefs.
Oh, and don’t expect attempts by experts to point out the holes in this view — to point out, in particular, that the image of a predatory China, running huge surpluses by keeping its currency undervalued, is years out of date — to make any impression. Members of the Trump team believe that all criticism of their economic ideas reflects a conspiracy among think tanks that are out to undermine them. Because of course they do.",negative
76,"When Tiah Joo Kim arrived at the Manhattan headquarters of the Trump Organization to pitch a hotel and condominium project in Vancouver, British Columbia, he expected the famous company with ventures across the globe to come with capacious offices and a staff of hundreds. Instead, he was led through a mere two floors with what appeared to be no more than a few dozen employees. “Lean,” Mr. Tiah, a young Malaysian developer, remembers thinking as he walked the halls.
The first stop was a conference room, where Mr. Tiah was required to sell his vision to the boss’s three oldest children. Only after securing their support did he advance to the inner sanctum, with its sweeping views of Central Park.
Mr. Tiah was not sure what to expect from the man whose face was beamed around the world through the reality television show “The Apprentice,” but the conversation that afternoon in 2012 was casual and warm. Donald J. Trump spent more time showing off a Shaquille O’Neal shoe and a Mike Tyson championship belt — prize artifacts from his display of sports memorabilia — than interrogating Mr. Tiah on the details of his business plan. “You’re a good-looking guy,” Mr. Tiah recalled Mr. Trump telling him as he gave the project his blessing.
Then Mr. Trump’s trusted lawyers and other top executives swooped in to play hardball — working alongside Donald Trump Jr. to negotiate the confidential agreements that would allow the Vancouver development to be branded with Mr. Trump’s name and managed by his company. The talks consumed 16-hour days for nearly a week, Mr. Tiah said, explaining: “It was tiring. They’re tough.”",negative
77,"But there is acknowledgment on both sides of the lectern that some re-examination of the system is warranted, especially at a time when news organizations, which must pay their way to follow the president, are increasingly hamstrung by budget constraints.
“The question really should be, why do you need a protective pool when everybody has cellphones?” said Marlin Fitzwater, who was the press secretary under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. “When you have a president who can operate a tweet and reach 28 million people from the driveway of any building in America, you don’t really need 14 people sitting there and watching him all night long.” (Mr. Trump’s Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, has about 18 million followers.)
Mr. Mason said that, since the election, the correspondents’ association and Mr. Trump’s team had “made a lot of progress in forming a protective pool” and that he was confident Mr. Trump would allow reporters to accompany him on Air Force One once he became president.
Mr. Trump’s team has floated the possibility of other changes as well. In his radio interview, Mr. Priebus hinted that the Trump administration might assume control of the seating assignments in the briefing room. The correspondents’ association has decided seating assignments since 1981, in large part because administrations of both parties did not want even the appearance of favoritism in determining press access.
Mr. Priebus’s remarks prompted concern that the new administration would try to usurp some of the association’s control.
Still, many said some kind of seating reform was appropriate.
Mr. McCurry and Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under George W. Bush, said they had discussed a setup that would allow a revolving group of journalists into the briefing room rather than reserving seats only for the existing White House press corps. Foreign journalists could attend on Wednesdays, for example, while alternative online media outlets such as Breitbart News and Think Progress could rotate in on Thursdays.
Breitbart — the hard-right website whose former chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, was named Mr. Trump’s chief strategist — is already part of Mr. Trump’s transition pool. The organization’s presence has raised some eyebrows, particularly in liberal media circles, because of its connection to Mr. Bannon. But members of the pools said they did not see it as an issue and pointed out that other partisan news outlets, like the left-leaning Huffington Post, were part of the pool.",positive
78,"A fake news article led to gunfire at a Washington pizzeria three weeks ago. Now it seems that another fake news story has prompted the defense minister of Pakistan to threaten to go nuclear.
The defense minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, wrote a saber-rattling Twitter post directed at Israel on Friday after a false report — which the minister apparently believed — that Israel had threatened Pakistan with nuclear weapons. Both countries have nuclear arsenals.
“Israeli def min threatens nuclear retaliation presuming pak role in Syria against Daesh,” the minister wrote on his official Twitter account, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “Israel forgets Pakistan is a Nuclear state too.”",neutral
79,"WASHINGTON — Realizing that his presidency could face potentially crippling questions over conflicts of interest, Donald J. Trump and his family are rushing to resolve potential controversies — like shuttering foundations and terminating development deals — even as the president-elect publicly maintains that no legal conflicts exist.
In recent days, the president-elect and his aides have said that he intends to distribute the assets of his personal charity and then close it down, has examined a plan to hire an outside monitor to oversee the Trump Organization and has terminated some international business projects.
“This is a process that my father and my family are taking incredibly seriously,” said Eric Trump, who will help oversee the Trump Organization, and who announced last week that he was terminating fund-raising for his own charity, the Eric Trump Foundation.
Even with these steps, Mr. Trump will enter the White House with a maze of financial holdings unlike those of any other president in American history. Many ethics experts still say the only way Mr. Trump can eliminate his most serious conflicts is to liquidate his company, and then put the money into a blind trust — a move Mr. Trump has so far rejected as impractical and unreasonable.",negative
80,"Maintaining a delicate balance on Taiwan’s status has been a foundational principle of United States-China relations and crucial to maintaining peace in Asia. Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade region that will eventually be incorporated in China, by force if necessary. Since 1978, the United States has recognized Beijing as China’s sole government, breaking diplomatic ties with Taiwan a year later, but Washington continues to have unofficial ties with Taiwan, sells weapons to the self-governing island, and has hinted it may defend Taiwan if it is attacked.
Mr. Trump told Fox News recently that he might reconsider the one-China policy as a way to exact Chinese concessions in disputes over currency manipulations, trade and Beijing’s moves to claim rocks and reefs in the South China Sea. He may think he is making an opening bid, but for China, Taiwan’s status is nonnegotiable.
Such talk, some experts fear, might mean that Mr. Trump would formally recognize Taiwan or embolden Taiwan to declare independence from China, either of which would bring swift reprisals. Alternatively, some worry that if China offers the right deal, Mr. Trump might abandon Taiwan by ending cooperation and billions of dollars in arms sales. Such a shift would shake the foundations of every international alliance and partnership the United States has spent decades building.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, is America’s largest trading partner, besides being a nuclear power and a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council. Heedless of these concerns, Mr. Trump has threatened to slap 45 percent tariffs on China and start a trade war that would penalize American consumers, who would have to pay more for imported Chinese goods. It would also hurt American businesses that seek to sell their products in the Chinese market. Beijing has already thrown a punch, warning last week that it could place sanctions against General Motors or Ford for monopolistic behavior, possibly as a response to an unfavorable shift in American policy.
There are plenty of ways for China to retaliate, from breaking off diplomatic relations if the United States formally recognizes Taiwan to buying planes from Europe’s Airbus instead of Boeing, to refusing to help curb North Korea’s nuclear program. There could also be more shows of force like the Chinese fighter jets that flew close to Taiwan late last month. And China could also restrict its investments and tourism to Taiwan, which would not be good for the island or the region.",negative
81,"Authoritarians with an animus against ethnic minorities are on the march across the Western world. They control governments in Hungary and Poland, and will soon take power in America. And they’re organizing across borders: Austria’s Freedom Party, founded by former Nazis, has signed an agreement with Russia’s ruling party — and met with Donald Trump’s choice for national security adviser.
But what should we call these groups? Many reporters are using the term “populist,” which seems both inadequate and misleading. I guess racism can be considered populist in the sense that it represents the views of some non-elite people. But are the other shared features of this movement — addiction to conspiracy theories, indifference to the rule of law, a penchant for punishing critics — really captured by the “populist” label?
Still, the European members of this emerging alliance — an axis of evil? — have offered some real benefits to workers. Hungary’s Fidesz party has provided mortgage relief and pushed down utility prices. Poland’s Law and Justice party has increased child benefits, raised the minimum wage and reduced the retirement age. France’s National Front is running as a defender of that nation’s extensive welfare state — but only for the right people.
Trumpism is, however, different. The campaign rhetoric may have included promises to keep Medicare and Social Security intact and replace Obamacare with something “terrific.” But the emerging policy agenda is anything but populist.",negative
82,"And Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, sent letters to the top ethics officials at 17 government agencies, asking if they had been in touch with officials of the Trump transition, whether they had received financial disclosure statements, and whether any Trump pick “refused to provide any information that you believe is necessary to conduct a conflicts analysis as required by law.”
“Given the large and complex financial holdings and boundless, serious potential for conflicts of interest,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in an email, “these nominees need to turn over all relevant financial and background information so that senators can thoroughly review their record before going forward with any hearings.”
Several of Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks would be among the wealthiest public servants in modern history. That alone presents a significant financial-vetting challenge to Senate Republicans, who hope to begin confirmation hearings in a few weeks. Mr. Trump’s selection process — begun, unlike that of most predecessors, after his election rather than before — may have added to the challenge of moving quickly now.
“They need to step on the gas and get it done,” said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush. “They need to tell the Senate what they are going to do with their assets.”",neutral
83,"After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Sechin aligned himself with Mr. Putin, another former K.G.B. officer, as he began consolidating power in post-Soviet politics. Everywhere Mr. Putin went, Mr. Sechin was by his side as a trusted aide and adviser.
In 2003, Russian authorities arrested Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the owner of Yukos, a huge oil company. At the time, Mr. Sechin was working as Mr. Putin’s deputy chief of staff, and though he had no formal judicial or investigatory authority, Mr. Khodorkovsky accused him of initiating his arrest — and the campaign that followed to nationalize Yukos. It’s impossible to know, but it seems likely. Following Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest, Rosneft absorbed Yukos’s assets. In 2004, Mr. Sechin was appointed to head Rosneft’s board.
Mr. Sechin isn’t just a businessman, though. He’s an influential political figure and a crucial Putin ally who has demonstrated his power. The arrest last month of Aleksei Ulyukayev, the minister of economic development, on charges of bribery was widely viewed as an act of revenge by Mr. Sechin. With the arrest, the first of an active government minister in post-Soviet Russia, he again confirmed his image as the most sinister man in the president’s inner circle.
Earlier this year, Mr. Sechin’s expansion was so aggressive that it seemed plausible that Mr. Putin himself would get tired of him, and would try to rid himself of such an odious comrade in arms.
Now Mr. Sechin has nothing to fear. A gift has arrived from across the ocean. This man, whose international experience up to this point has been limited to his friendship with Hugo Chávez, the deceased president of Venezuela, has an exclusive international trump card that even Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov lacks.
Mr. Sechin’s friend will head GosDep, against which Mr. Putin’s entire domestic policy has been directed. It’s a stunning boon for the Kremlin and a crushing blow to everyone in Russia who has counted on the State Department to maintain anti-Putin positions, however restrained they might be.
Even for Mr. Putin, the good fortune that Mr. Trump’s election has brought is less obvious than what it has done for the man who has been first his aide and then his deputy on matters of petroleum — a man who has suddenly become an influential player not only in Russia, but also in world politics.",negative
84,"WASHINGTON — On the heels of headline-grabbing price spikes on prescription drugs, a bipartisan Senate report on Wednesday will call on Congress to take action to prevent huge, unjustified cost increases on decades-old prescription medicines that have no competition.
The Senate Special Committee on Aging, reporting the results of a yearlong investigation, said that some drug companies behaved like hedge funds because of the influence of “activist investors.” These companies, the committee said, have developed a “business model that harms patients, taxpayers and the U.S. health care system.”
For years, Republicans have sided with drug companies in resisting legislation to restrain drug prices, on the ground that drug makers need additional revenue to pay for research. But President-elect Donald J. Trump scrambled the politics of the issue during the campaign, and the committee’s call for action comes amid a changing political dynamic.
During his quest for the presidency, Mr. Trump promised to “remove barriers to entry” of “imported safe and dependable drugs from overseas.” He and his staff have not provided details, and it is unclear whether he intends to push for such a proposal. But he told Time magazine after the election: “I’m going to bring down drug prices. I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices.”",negative
85,"Titan Atlas and D B Pace, which are named as defendants in the suit, have rejected the claims.
Donald Trump Jr., who along with his brother Eric is expected to run the Trump Organization when their father becomes president, did not respond to written questions from The New York Times. A lawyer for the Trump Organization, Alan Garten, said the younger Mr. Trump was only a “passive investor” in Titan Atlas and was never involved with D B Pace or the management of the North Charleston property.
Mr. Cohen, who in his capacity as a D B Pace executive signed the company’s application to the South Carolina program, did not respond to an email seeking his responses.
Mr. Boyd, the environmental lawyer, said a decision about D B Pace’s ability to use the state program would require an extensive legal analysis. But he added that any ties between Donald Trump Jr., Titan Atlas, D B Pace and the Trump Organization could complicate or violate the affiliation issue.
A decision by South Carolina officials could have significant legal and financial consequences. If the voluntary cleanup agreement is approved, the costs incurred by D B Pace would probably be minimal because its environmental obligations would be limited to controlling the spread of existing pollution on the property. But if regulators reject the agreement, the Trump affiliate could bear legal responsibility for damage caused by previous occupants, including Titan Atlas.
Titan Atlas, which manufactured precast construction panels at the North Charleston site, never applied to take part in the state’s voluntary cleanup program. On a recent day, the property was littered with rusting equipment and rotting chemical drums. The factory on the site once functioned as a Lockheed Martin plant that made aircraft adhesives.",negative

145,"Despite calls from Democrats to review President Trump’s tax returns and make them public, a congressional tax oversight committee will reportedly not pursue the documents for review.
Trump’s tax returns could show conflicts of interest that would otherwise go undetected, opponents say. The Republican head of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee said it is improtant to protect privacy.
“If Congress begins to use its powers to rummage around in the tax returns of the president, what prevents Congress from doing the same to average Americans?” Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, told Reuters. “Privacy and civil liberties are still important rights in this country, and (the) Ways and Means Committee is not going to start to weaken them.”
Last month, Kellyanne Conway, top adviser to Trump, said he will not release his tax returns, appearing to shut the door on a decades-long tradition of transparency.
Every president since 1976 has released their returns. During the campaign, Trump refused to make his filings public, saying they were under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and saying he'd release them after that review is complete.
Conway was asked about a petition on the White House website signed by more than 200,000 people calling for Trump to release his returns.
""The White House response is that he's not going to release his tax returns,"" she said in an interview. ""We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care.""
Rep. Bill Pascrell, a Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee said he continues to hope for action on the returns.
""Our committee must respond by using its legal authority as Congress has in the past to provide proper oversight. This is Checks and Balances 101,"" he told Reuters.
""There is only one logical explanation for Mr. Trump's refusal to release his returns: there is a bombshell in them,"" he continued. ""Given Mr. Trump's equanimity with other flaws in his history, we can only assume it's a bombshell of unusual size.""
However, polls appear to show a majority of Americans want Trump to release the returns. A Fox News Poll revealed in September that 60 percent of Americans believed Trump was hiding something in his tax returns.
Trump has maintained that you learn very little from tax returns.",positive
146,"It’s been about three weeks since President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The Fox News Poll checked in with voters nationwide to get a read on how things are going.
Here are five findings on the new administration. Voters feel:
-- Divided over Trump.
-- A bit more confident in Trump’s judgment than they did before the election.
-- Optimistic on the economy, pessimistic on health care, and mixed on security.
-- Repealing and replacing Obamacare and cutting taxes should be higher priorities than building the wall.
-- Trump’s election victory was a bigger surprise than the Patriots’ Super Bowl comeback.
Here are the numbers behind those bullet points:
When asked if the Trump administration is working on things that will help their family, 47 percent of voters say yes, while 48 percent say no.
That’s almost identical to the split over President Trump’s job performance: 48 percent approve and 47 percent disapprove. Moreover, most voters feel strongly one way or the other, as 35 percent “strongly” approve and 41 percent “strongly” disapprove.
CLICK TO READ THE FULL FOX NEWS POLL
Nearly all Republicans approve (87 percent), as do just over half of independents (52 percent). Among Democrats, 10 percent give him the thumbs up.
For comparison, after Barack Obama’s first month as president, 60 percent of voters approved of the job he was doing, including 90 percent of Democrats, 62 percent of independents, and 29 percent of Republicans (February 2009).
The poll, released Tuesday, finds 50 percent feel confident in Trump’s judgment in a crisis, up from 43 percent in October 2016. Yet nearly half, 49 percent, lack confidence in his judgment. In addition, about half of voters describe Trump as a “strong leader” (52-45 percent).
Where will things stand after Trump’s first year? In spite of his mixed approval rating, by a 55-35 percent margin, voters feel the economy will be stronger a year from now. That includes more than one in five Democrats (22 percent). There’s less optimism on health care coverage, as voters expect it will be harder (48 percent) rather than easier to get coverage next year (35 percent) -- likely due to Trump’s pledge to repeal Obamacare. Meanwhile, 46 percent think the U.S. will be safer a year from now, while 43 percent say less safe.
In Trump’s first 100 days in office, twice as many voters say it’s extremely or very important for him to work on cutting taxes (52 percent) and repealing Obamacare (49 percent), than building a border wall (26 percent). Among Republicans, 76 percent prioritize repealing Obamacare and 74 percent cutting taxes, while just 47 percent say the same of building the wall.
For many, the unique way Trump won the election made it unexpected -- with a big Electoral College advantage despite losing the popular vote by more than two percentage points. Some compared it to this year’s Super Bowl, in which the New England Patriots overcame a 28-3 third-quarter deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons.
Which was more surprising? Voters say it was Trump’s win by a 56-35 percent margin. Among Hillary Clinton voters, 76 percent say Trump. That’s more than twice the number of Trump voters who say the same (37 percent).
Trump’s win also bothered more people than the Patriots’ victory (49-27 percent). That’s largely driven by the fact that 91 percent of Clinton voters were bothered more by the election, while for Trump voters it was the Super Bowl (52 percent) or neither event (39 percent).
The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,013 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from February 11-13, 2017. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",positive
147,"A majority of voters thinks President Trump’s executive order on immigration is better described as a restriction on terrorist hot spots than as a “Muslim ban.” And more think the action makes the U.S. safer than say it makes the country less safe.
Even so, more disapprove (52 percent) than approve (46 percent) of the temporary travel ban.
That’s according to a Fox News Poll released Tuesday.
CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS POLL RESULTS
The least popular part of the executive order is the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees, as 53 percent say it “went too far.”
About as many, 51 percent, think the 120-day ban on all refugees from entering the U.S. “went too far,” and 48 percent feel that way about the 90-day ban on citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries.
Twelve percent overall, and 25 percent of Trump voters, think the travel ban on the seven countries “didn’t go far enough.”
For each element, nearly 4 voters in 10 think the ban was “about right.”
Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order has been halted in federal court. The administration has not yet said what steps it will take next to try to implement the policy.
The poll asked voters to choose between two descriptions of the executive order: 56 percent think it’s better described as a “restriction on people entering the United States from known terrorist hot spots.” Some 37 percent say “a Muslim ban” is more accurate.
Meanwhile, by a 42-33 percent margin, voters think the travel ban makes the United States safer rather than less safe. About one-quarter say it doesn’t make much difference (24 percent).
Donald Trump voters are more likely to say the ban makes the country safer by an 81-point margin (84-3 percent), and fully 92 percent of them approve of the overall travel ban.
Only seven percent of those who supported Hillary Clinton approve of the ban, and they think it makes the country “less safe” by a 55-point margin (62-7 percent).

President Trump spoke about the depletion of the U.S. military in his inaugural address. Voters agree.
The poll finds that 58 percent think the military is “stretched too thin,” and a 45-percent plurality feels it is underfunded. Twenty-five percent think the federal government spends too much on the military, while another 25 percent think it spends the right amount.
In addition, voters are nearly three times as likely to say the military has gotten weaker rather than stronger over the last eight years (41 vs. 15 percent). Among veterans, 56 percent say it has gotten weaker.
The partisan divide is wide. Republicans (77 percent) are nearly twice as likely Democrats (40 percent) to say the military is stretched too thin, and more than nine times as likely to think it has gotten weaker over the last eight years (74 percent and 8 percent respectively). And on funding priorities, 66 percent of Republicans think the government spends too little on the military, while just 25 percent of Democrats say the same.

148,"U.S. authorities on Monday said they arrested nearly 700 undocumented immigrants as part of a series of raids tied to President Trump’s executive order to find and deport 11 million people living in the United States illegally.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested 680 people from Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, San Antonio and New York City last week whom they say pose a threat to public safety. Of those, 170 have no criminal record.
During a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump praised Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and said the raids were fulfilling a campaign promise.
Kelly emphasized that the operations were ""routine” though immigration advocates claim ICE’s actions go well beyond what the previous administration did.
The executive order Trump signed last month gives the Department of Homeland Security the power to go after undocumented immigrants who have minor offenses or no convictions at all.
“President Trump has been clear in affirming the critical mission of DHS in protecting the nation and directed our Department to focus on removing illegal aliens who have violated our immigration laws, with a specific focus on those who pose a threat to public safety, have been charged with criminal offenses, have committed immigration violations or have been deported and re-entered the country illegally,” Kelly said.
Kelly added that of the 680 people arrested, 75 percent were “criminal aliens.” Some of the crimes included homicide, aggravated sexual abuse, drug trafficking, DUI and weapons charges.
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday he will ask ICE for more information about the arrests – including the locations and more details about the people detained - and called reports that ICE targeted non-violent immigrant families “deeply disturbing.”
“Undocumented immigrants live in fear, and they are confused and scared,” Schumer said.
The New York Democrat also called out ICE for its lack of transparency and potential due process violations.
“I have always supported smart immigration enforcement that helps to keep our country safe, but raids targeting law-abiding immigrants and treating those with traffic violations the same as murderers and robbers will only achieve the opposite,” he said.",positive
149,"A longtime friend of Donald Trump said Sunday that the president should make some changes and the first move should be firing his chief of staff.
Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media, said in interviews with several news outlets that Reince Priebus was in over his head and blamed him for the poor rollout of Trump’s travel ban. He added that order in the White House might not be restored until Priebus leaves.
“It’s my view that Reince is the problem. I think on paper Reince looked good as the chief of staff — and Donald trusted him — but it’s pretty clear the guy is in way over his head,” Ruddy told The Washington Post.
“He’s not knowledgeable of how federal agencies work, how the communications operations work. He botched this whole immigration rollout. This should’ve been a win for Donald, not two or three weeks of negative publicity.”
Ruddy tweeted that he and Trump talked over drinks at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort late Friday, but Ruddy insisted he was only speaking for himself, and not Trump.
Ruddy spoke with The Post shortly after he told CNN he thought there was “a lot of weakness coming out of the chief of staff.”
Ruddy attempted to walk some of the comments he made on network, saying in a tweet that Priebus had briefed him on some of the ""impressive"" new White House plans. He also tweeted that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, was doing a terrific job.
According to the New York Times, Ruddy had told Priebus that he would stand by his criticisms, but would “meet up and have dinner in the near future.”
The White House defended the chief of staff after Ruddy’s comments.
“The president has made unbelievable progress in just his first 21 days, bringing back jobs, saving taxpayers money and securing the nation. Reince has successfully led the team that has implemented President Trump’s agenda,” White House deputy communications director Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.
Another senior White House official told the paper whether Ruddy’s comments were relevant, saying “This sounds like somebody with an ax to grind who has no real access to the president.”
Though Ruddy had criticism for Priebus, he sang the praises of White House press secretary Sean Spicer and other administration officials who were scrutinized about the travel ban.

150,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a polar opposite to Donald Trump in almost every way, joined the new U.S. president at the White House Monday keen to build a relationship that doesn't threaten trade.
Trudeau arrived on a blustery morning, and Trump greeted him with a firm handshake. The neighboring leaders are expected to talk about free trade in their first face-to-face meeting.
Trudeau and Trump will also participate in a roundtable discussion about women in the workplace.
The prime minister's plane landed at Dulles airport after heavy winds forced a change from Andrews Air Force Base.
Trudeau, age 45, and Trump, age 70, have vastly different outlooks of the world.
Trudeau is a liberal who champions free trade and has welcomed 40,000 Syrian refugees. He calls himself a feminist and his Cabinet is 50 percent women. Trump has few women in his Cabinet. He has taken a protectionist stance on trade and wants to crack down on the inflow of migrants and refugees.
Trump's order to temporarily halt entry into the U.S. by people from seven predominantly Muslim nations, which is tied up in court, might come up during his bilateral meeting with Trudeau. But Trudeau is expected to focus on common economic interests.
Relations with the U.S. are crucial as more than 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S., while 18 percent of U.S. exports go to Canada. There are fears among Canadians that they could be hurt as Trump targets Mexico in a re-negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
A White House official and a senior Canadian government official said the two countries plan to launch a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. The officials agreed to confirm the move only if they were not quoted by name because they were not authorized to make the information public.
Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter who has been an advocate for policies benefiting working women, was involved in recruiting participants and setting the agenda for the roundtable. Female executives from the United States and Canada are expected to participate.
Trudeau's close cooperation with Trump and the first daughter could ease some worries among Canadians that the U.S. president will enact protectionist measures that could hurt the Canadian economy. It could also alleviate some fears that Trump will be as combative with Trudeau as he has been with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
The Canadian official said Trudeau's administration had suggested the task force, because the prime minister considers the issue of working women an important part of his agenda and economic growth plan.
""It's a smart thing if Canada proposed this,"" said Nelson Wiseman, a professor at the University of Toronto. ""It takes attention off of NAFTA. And from Trump's point of view, it contributes to softening Trump's image, and he's got a problem with women.""
Roland Paris, a former senior foreign policy to Trudeau, said the prime minister needs to build a relationship with Trump to ensure Canada is not shut out economically.
""The overriding priority will be for Canada to maintain secure and reliable access to the U.S. market and the supply chains that crisscross the border,"" Paris said.
Trudeau, whose father was the late Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has been preparing for the Trump meeting for months. He will also meet with legislative leaders on Capitol Hill.",positive
151,"The Senate confirmed former Goldman Sachs financier Steven Mnuchin as President Donald Trump's Treasury secretary Monday, despite objections by Democrats who charged that Mnuchin had made much of his fortune by foreclosing on struggling homeowners during the financial crisis.
Mnuchin was confirmed 53-47, with West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin joining all 52 Republicans to vote in the affirmative.
Moments later, physician David Shulkin was unanimously confirmed as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Mnuchin and Shulkin bring the total of confirmed members of Trump's Cabinet to eight, joining the secretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services and Transportation, as well as the Attorney General.
Trump hailed Mnuchin, who was sworn in later Monday evening, as ""a financial legend with an incredible track record of success."" He said Mnuchin had spent his entire career making money in the private sector and now will go to work on behalf of the American taxpayer.
As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin is expected to play a key role in Republican efforts to overhaul the nation's tax code for the first time in three decades. Trump has promised to unveil a proposal in the coming weeks.
Mnuchin, the former finance chairman for Trump's presidential campaign, will also be in charge of imposing economic sanctions on foreign governments and individuals, including Russia.
The president, who has known Mnuchin for years, said his longtime friend will help make the U.S. a ""jobs magnet.""
""He'll work 24 hours a day, I know him. He'll work 28 hours a day if they give him the extra four hours,"" he said.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Mnuchin ""is smart, he's capable, and he's got impressive private-sector experience.""
Democrats complained that Mnuchin had profited by foreclosing on families during the financial crisis.
In 2009, Mnuchin assembled a group of investors to buy the failed IndyMac bank, whose collapse the year before was the second biggest bank failure of the financial crisis. He renamed it OneWest and turned it around, selling it for a handsome profit in 2014.
""Mr. Mnuchin has made his career profiting from the misfortunes of working people,"" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. ""OneWest was notorious for taking an especially aggressive role in foreclosing on struggling homeowners.""
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said, ""I simply cannot forgive somebody who took a look at that banking crisis and took a look at the pain that Wall Street had sent in a wave across all of America, and thought, 'Ah, there's a great new way to make money, foreclosing on people.'""
Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, called Mnuchin ""the foreclosure king.""
Mnuchin has said he had worked hard during the financial crisis to assist homeowners with refinancing so that they could remain in their homes.
But several Democratic senators raised examples of residents in their states who they said were not treated fairly by OneWest, including elderly homeowners and members of the military.
Democrats also complained that Mnuchin failed to disclose nearly $100 million in assets on forms he filed with the Senate Finance Committee.
In his testimony before the committee, Mnuchin defended his actions while heading OneWest. He said he had worked hard during the financial crisis to assist homeowners with refinancing so that they could remain in their homes.
He told the committee that his bank had extended more than 100,000 loan modifications to borrowers.
Mnuchin called his failure to disclose assets an oversight. After meeting with committee staff Mnuchin amended his disclosure forms and also disclosed his position as director of Dune Capital International in the Cayman Islands, a well-known offshore tax haven.
When pressed by Democrats to explain the omissions, Mnuchin said: ""I did not use a Cayman Island entity in any way to avoid taxes for myself. There was no benefit to me.""
The Treasury Department is responsible for a wide range of activities, including advising the president on economic and financial issues. The department oversees the IRS, negotiates tax treaties with other countries, imposes economic sanctions against foreign governments and individuals, and targets the financial networks of terrorist groups and drug cartels.
The department also issues the bonds that finance the government's deficit spending.
Republicans and Democrats praised Shulkin, who is charged with delivering on Trump's campaign promises to fix long-standing problems at Veterans Affairs.
Shulkin, 57, a former Obama administration official, has been the VA's top health official since 2015. He secured the backing of Senate Democrats after pledging at his confirmation hearing to always protect veterans' interests, even if it meant disagreeing at times with Trump.
He has ruled out fully privatizing the agency and says wide-scale firings of VA employees are unnecessary, describing the VA workforce as ""the best in health care.""

152,"The media are finally coming out of denial.
This is Donald J. Trump, and he ain’t going to change.
All the talk about how he would change his style once he got to the White House (which Trump himself encouraged now and then) was misguided.
His bombastic, combative and sometimes frenetic approach to life is what got him elected, so of course he’s going to stick with it. And when aides tell him he needs to change, he’ll obviously think that he heard that advice throughout the campaign he was expected to lose.
Now it’s true that actually becoming president is the ultimate reality check. And that’s true for any new White House occupant. Harry Truman famously said of Dwight Eisenhower, “He’ll sit here, and he’ll say, ‘Do this! Do that!’ And nothing will happen. Poor Ike—it won’t be a bit like the Army.”
And that was inevitable for a real estate mogul who ran his company with an iron hand. A president has to deal with all these checks and balances—Congress, the courts, the opposition party, the media and special interests, as well as other world leaders. And things move far more slowly than in the corporate world.
But anyone who thought Trump would adopt a measured, stately approach doesn’t understand the man. To be sure, he’ll have to adapt to the unique challenges of the presidency. But his bam-bam-bam approach, including the tweeting at all hours, revs up his supporters. And his detractors aren’t likely to warm to him even if he starts reading boring speeches.
The Washington Post makes it official:
“Despite all predictions — including his own — that the country would see a new, more ‘presidential’ Trump once he took office, the commander in chief has barely changed from the impulsive candidate who blew up every political norm that stood between him and the White House.
“He is still tweeting at odd hours, calling people names, promoting his family’s business interests, bragging about crowd sizes, complaining about media coverage and lashing out at anyone who challenges him, including members of his own party and a federal judge. His White House seems just as chaotic, tumultuous and discordant as his campaign was.”
Says Politico: “Being president is harder than Donald Trump thought, according to aides and allies who say that he’s growing increasingly frustrated with the challenges of running the massive federal bureaucracy.
“In interviews, nearly two dozen people who’ve spent time with Trump in the three weeks since his inauguration said that his mood has careened between surprise and anger as he’s faced the predictable realities of governing, from congressional delays over his cabinet nominations and legal fights holding up his aggressive initiatives to staff in-fighting and leaks.”
But wouldn’t any new president face an attitude adjustment when confronting the magnitude of domestic and world problems? Every new president makes mistakes—you could look it up—and tries to grapple with only a fraction of his team in place.
What if what the Post calls his “tumultuous” style works for Trump? Obviously there have been a number of unforced errors, including the rushed travel ban, and policy zig-zags. But Trump’s voters didn’t elect him to preside over a tidy organizational chart. They want results, and unlike the process-obsessed press, they don’t particularly care how he gets there.",positive
153,"President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held a joint press conference Monday, in which they discussed a number of issues, including U.S.-Canada relations, trade and the Syrian refugee crisis.

154,"The White House has riled the country's civil libertarian wing after President Trump enthusiastically voiced support for a controversial law enforcement tool that allows an individual’s property or assets to be seized without a guilty verdict.
The president weighed in on what's known as ""civil asset forfeiture"" during an Oval Office meeting last week with sheriffs. The president, who ran on a law-and-order message, said he shared their desire to strengthen the practice and even said he would “destroy” the career of a Texas politician trying to end it.
The comments revived tensions with libertarians who have been fighting the practice under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Already piqued by the selection of former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a vocal supporter of asset forfeiture, to lead the Justice Department, the Libertarian Party itself condemned the comments.
“It was really disappointing to hear those words. He campaigned on the idea of helping people who are on the low end of the economic spectrum and this [law] disproportionately affects minorities and those who do not have the means to hire an attorney,” Libertarian National Committee Chair Nicholas Sarwark told Fox News.
Sarwark called the practice ""immoral,"" adding that it is simply “government theft of individual property that flips the nation’s legal system on its head.”
While laws differ across the country, most states allow law enforcement to seize an individual’s assets or property on the suspicion they have been involved in criminal activity. Even if a person is found to be not guilty, some jurisdictions allow the government to keep their property.
Sheriff John Aubrey of Louisville, Ky., said he was heartened by his meeting with Trump because he, unlike the last administration, will give them a ""fair hearing"" on asset forfeiture.
He also believes there is a misconception that police just take property but stressed that they cannot do so before getting a court order.
Trump signaled he would fight reform efforts in Congress, saying politicians could “get beat up really badly by the voters” if they pursue laws to limit police authority.
The comments could signal an abrupt halt to efforts to curb the practice under the Obama administration, which also had faced heavy criticism from civil libertarians and criminal justice reform advocates.
Brittany Hunter of the free-market Foundation for Economic Education wrote that the president’s “egregious comments” effectively destroy “any hope that his administration will be better on this issue than President Obama. In fact, the situation may very well become worse.”
According to the Institute for Justice, a civil liberties law firm, the Department of Justice’s Assets Forfeiture Fund generated $93.7 million in revenue in 1986. By 2014, the annual figure had reached $4.5 billion -- a 4,667 percent increase. The practice surged for years under the Obama administration.
While critics believe the policy creates a profit incentive for law enforcement, police organizations say it is an important tool and charges of abuse have been blown out of proportion.
“There are those who see an incident of one and want to apply the rule of many, but we have found the annual number of incidents [of abuse] is miniscule,” Jonathan Thompson of the National Sheriffs Association told Fox News.
Thompson said the issue was addressed in a conversation with Sessions, who views it as a priority, and he believes the Trump administration will be more supportive than the Obama administration in lifting “the burden on local law enforcement.”
He added that law enforcement are not opposed to reforms and that he plans to keep his focus on increasing independent judicial review and transparency.
Candidates running on the Libertarian ticket in the midterm elections are likely to make Trump’s record on criminal justice reform and the Sessions selection an issue, in a bid to peel off voters from across the political spectrum.
“Our candidates will make [asset forfeiture] an issue for Republicans and Democrats on the state and federal level in 2018. We will make them answer to voters on these issues,” Sarwark warned.
Many of the states key to Trump’s victory have passed reforms.
Last year, Ohio passed a law that prohibits taking assets valued at less than $15,000 without a criminal conviction. Other states also passed differing degrees of reform, including New Hampshire, Florida, Montana, Nebraska, Minnesota, Maryland and New Mexico.
Largely an uncontroversial issue for decades, the government’s war on drugs in the 1980s led to its rapid expansion, but media coverage of abuses has led to a public blowback.
A 2015 report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), found that of those Philadelphia residents who had their assets taken, nearly one-third were never convicted of a crime and that almost 60 percent of cash seizures were for amounts less than $250.
“Civil asset forfeiture reform is an area where you cannot ignore the public demand,” said Kanya Bennett, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.",positive
155,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a polar opposite to Donald Trump in almost every way, joined the new U.S. president at the White House Monday keen to build a relationship that doesn't threaten trade.
Trudeau arrived on a blustery morning, and Trump greeted him with a firm handshake. The neighboring leaders are expected to talk about free trade in their first face-to-face meeting.
Trudeau and Trump will also participate in a roundtable discussion about women in the workplace.
The prime minister's plane landed at Dulles airport after heavy winds forced a change from Andrews Air Force Base.
Trudeau, age 45, and Trump, age 70, have vastly different outlooks of the world.
Trudeau is a liberal who champions free trade and has welcomed 40,000 Syrian refugees. He calls himself a feminist and his Cabinet is 50 percent women. Trump has few women in his Cabinet. He has taken a protectionist stance on trade and wants to crack down on the inflow of migrants and refugees.
Trump's order to temporarily halt entry into the U.S. by people from seven predominantly Muslim nations, which is tied up in court, might come up during his bilateral meeting with Trudeau. But Trudeau is expected to focus on common economic interests.
Relations with the U.S. are crucial as more than 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S., while 18 percent of U.S. exports go to Canada. There are fears among Canadians that they could be hurt as Trump targets Mexico in a re-negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
A White House official and a senior Canadian government official said the two countries plan to launch a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. The officials agreed to confirm the move only if they were not quoted by name because they were not authorized to make the information public.
Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter who has been an advocate for policies benefiting working women, was involved in recruiting participants and setting the agenda for the roundtable. Female executives from the United States and Canada are expected to participate.
Trudeau's close cooperation with Trump and the first daughter could ease some worries among Canadians that the U.S. president will enact protectionist measures that could hurt the Canadian economy. It could also alleviate some fears that Trump will be as combative with Trudeau as he has been with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
The Canadian official said Trudeau's administration had suggested the task force, because the prime minister considers the issue of working women an important part of his agenda and economic growth plan.
""It's a smart thing if Canada proposed this,"" said Nelson Wiseman, a professor at the University of Toronto. ""It takes attention off of NAFTA. And from Trump's point of view, it contributes to softening Trump's image, and he's got a problem with women.""
Roland Paris, a former senior foreign policy to Trudeau, said the prime minister needs to build a relationship with Trump to ensure Canada is not shut out economically.
""The overriding priority will be for Canada to maintain secure and reliable access to the U.S. market and the supply chains that crisscross the border,"" Paris said.

157,"President Trump’s assertions about widespread voter fraud in the 2016 elections re-emerged this weekend, with a top Trump adviser saying Sunday the White House has provided “enormous evidence” to support claims while still producing no evidence.
“The White House has provided enormous evidence with respect to voter fraud, with respect to people being registered in more than one state,” White House policy adviser Stephen Miller told ABC’s “This Week,” amid calls for Trump to provide evidence for his claim.
Trump has argued since November that voter fraud cost him the popular vote, which he lost to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by several million ballots. However, the White House has yet to provide evidence, at least publicly, to support the argument.
“This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence,” Miller said. “But I can tell you this: Voter fraud is a serious problem in this country.”
The issues of voter and voter-registratration fraud came into play again last week after a closed-door meeting with senators and former New Hampshire GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who with Trump lost that state on Election Day.
Trump purportedly said in the meeting that thousands of people were brought from Massachusetts to New Hampshire to “illegally” vote.
Miller said Sunday that he has worked on election campaigns in New Hampshire and that the situation is widely known in the state’s political circles, though he did not provide any hard-copy evidence.
“Go to New Hampshire. Talk to anybody who has worked in politics there for a long time,” he said. “Everybody is aware of the problem.”
Trump’s claim about New Hampshire prompted a Federal Election Commission official to urge the president to share evidence supporting his allegation so it can be investigated.
And Trump last week told Fox News that he’s going to have Vice President Pence lead a commission to investigate voter-registration fraud.
The president in recent weeks has gotten some support on the issue from fellow Republicans who have said voter fraud has occurred in their states.
However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he doesn’t want to spend federal money to investigate the issue.
North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows told reporters at the recent Republican retreat in Philadelphia that he’s aware of instances of voter fraud in his congressional district but was uncertain about the extent.
Miller said Sunday that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach has evidence of vote fraud in his state.
“I suggest you invite Kris Kobach onto your show, and he can walk you through some of the evidence,” Miller said.
And last week, a Mexican national was sentenced to eight years in prison for voter fraud in Texas. The woman’s lawyer suggested that people in that region believing Trump's claims about election rigging led to the conviction and harsh sentencing, calling it the “800-pound gorilla"" in the jury box.

158,"The head of the International Monetary Fund said Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump taking office is likely good for the American economy in the short term, though rising interest rates and a strengthening dollar will challenge global trade.
Christine Lagarde said Trump's plans for additional investment in U.S. infrastructure and his likely tax reforms will boost America's economic fortunes.
However, Lagarde acknowledged that Trump's policies likely will squeeze international markets.
""That's a tightening that is going to be difficult on the global economy and for which economies have to prepare,"" Lagarde said during an event at the World Government Summit in Dubai.
Asked how the world missed Trump's rise and the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union, Lagarde described a creeping, ""insidious"" push toward anti-globalization and protectionist thought.
""We have been saying globalization is great, international trade is great — and it is,"" she said. ""But we have not looked at those who were badly, negatively impacted.""
She blamed those negative impacts in part on the rise of robots taking jobs, as well as the shrinking gains of the global middle class.
Lagarde cautiously sidestepped questions on her thoughts about Trump being in the White House by saying ""this is really a work in progress — there's been of announcements, a lot of tweets, a lot of things being said.""
Still, she stressed the importance of data and facts in making decisions.

159,"President Trump tweeted Saturday to support and defend key national-security initiatives -- arguing refugees from “dangerous” countries are streaming into the U.S. while courts halt his travel ban and suggesting that he can undercut the projected, multi-billion-dollar cost for his border wall.
“I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN!,” Trump said over two, 140-character-maximum tweets.
The Department of Homeland Security said this past week that the U.S.-Mexico border wall will cost roughly $21.6 billion and take three-and-a-half years to build.
Trump, a former businessman and real estate magnate, is known for his deal-making, in fact having written a book in 1987 titled “The Art of the Deal.”

161,"Immigration arrests across Southern California over the past week were planned before President Trump took office and could be compared to similar operations the occurred last summer, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said.
The Los Angeles Times reported that authorities arrested more than 160 people in the five-day sweep, most of whom have criminal histories.
David Marin, the director, told the paper that most of those arrested had prior felony convictions, but a few were taken in because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
He said five people would not have met the Obama administration's enforcement priorities but were arrested because they were found to be in the country illegally.
“The rash of these recent reports about ICE checkpoints and random sweeps and the like, it’s all false, and that’s definitely dangerous and irresponsible,” Marin told the paper. “Reports like that create panic, and they put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger.”
He said similar operations took place this week in Atlanta, New York and Chicago.
Immigrant advocates decried a series of arrests that federal deportation agents said aimed to round up criminals in Southern California but they believe mark a shift in enforcement under the Trump administration.
Advocates began fielding calls Thursday from immigrants and their lawyers reporting raids at homes and businesses in the greater Los Angeles area.
In one instance, agents knocked on one door looking for a man and ended up arresting another who is in the country illegally but has no criminal record — something Angelica Salas, the executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, said would not likely have happened previously.
""This was not normal,"" Salas told reporters Friday.
The announcement of the arrests comes days after an Arizona woman was arrested and deported to Mexico after what she thought was a routine check in with immigration officials and amid heightened anxiety among immigrant communities since Trump signed an executive order to expand deportations.
A decade ago, immigration officers searching for specific individuals would often arrest others found along the way, a practice that drew criticism from advocates. Under the Obama administration, agents also carried out arrests but focused more narrowly on specific individuals.
In the suburbs of Los Angeles, 50-year-old house painter Manuel Mosqueda was there when his fiancé answered the door, thinking it was police, his 21-year-old daughter Marlene said.
""They were looking for someone else and they took my dad in the process,"" she said.
Karla Navarrete, a lawyer for CHIRLA, said she sought to stop Mosqueda from being placed on a bus to Mexico and was told by ICE that things had changed. She said another lawyer filed federal court papers to halt his removal.
Salas said the agency provided scant details to lawyers who headed to the detention center in response to the phone calls, and in the past was more forthcoming with information.
She also said there is increased anxiety in the community about immigration enforcement since Trump's order.
Democratic state lawmakers denounced the arrests and urged immigrants to know their rights and what to do if approached by federal authorities.
“Even under Obama we had sweeps or big operations where they would go into a particular neighborhood or say that this week we’re going to do a big operation and arrest people with certain profiles in certain parts of the city,” Jennie Pasquarella, a director of immigrant rights for the ACLU, said. “The piece of it that is new is some of the reports that we were getting yesterday indicating that there were people [arrested] who did not have any criminal convictions at all.”

162,"Several towns, cities and counties around the nation are caving to President Trump's threat to pull funding, and abandoning their ""sanctuary"" pledges to shield illegal immigrants from federal authorities.
Dayton, Ohio, dropped a policy that restricted the city’s cooperation with immigration officials pursuing illegal immigrants arrested for misdemeanors or felony property crimes, according to the Dayton Daily News. Police Chief Richard Biehl said federal authorities will no longer be impeded by the city when pursuing illegal immigrants being held by his department.
Other communities that have dropped policies of shielding illegal immigrant suspects from Immigration and Customs Enforcement include Miami-Dade and Dayton, are Saratoga, N.Y., Finney County, Kan., and Bedford, Penn., according to The Center for Immigration Studies, which keeps a list of sanctuary communities.
“We are reviewing policy changes at a multitude of other jurisdictions as well,” said Marguerite Telford, CIS’s director of communications, who said the organization is “being inundated” by officials on its sanctuary map who want to be taken off.
The mayor of Miami-Dade County, which was considered a sanctuary community, made headlines recently when he changed a policy that called for refusing to hold arrested immigrants for immigration officials unless they committed to reimbursing the county for the cost of detention.
Telling reporters that he did not want to imperil hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding, Mayor Carlos Gimenez ordered jails to comply with federal immigration detention requests.
The changes have come on the heels of President Trump’s executive order giving the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security the power to cut federal funding to communities that are deemed sanctuaries for illegal immigrants. Trump also has authorized the DHS to publish a weekly list of sanctuary communities.
CIS, and other groups that favor strict immigration enforcement, laud Trump’s move.
“Are you really going to pick and choose what laws you’re going to enforce?” asked Telford. “If you want a change [in immigration policy], go to the legislature.”
While some communities are rethinking their sanctuary policies under the pressure of losing funding, public officials of others, particularly major cities, have vowed to defy Trump’s orders.
“We’re going to defend all of our people regardless of where they come from, regardless of their immigration status,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York at a recent press conference.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel also vowed to protect illegal immigrants, including ones suspected or convicted of crimes, from the feds.
“I want to be clear: We’re going to stay a sanctuary city,"" Emanuel said. ""There is no stranger among us… you are welcome in Chicago as you pursue the American dream.”
The ""sanctuary"" term describes cities that employ a range of uncooperation with federal immigration authorities. Some refuse to hold suspects and even convicts who have completed their sentences for the feds to deport. Others refuse to furnish the feds with information on illegal immigrants who land on their radar through more benign activity.
Forbes contributor Adam Andrzejewski reported that more than 300 government jurisdictions claim to be sanctuaries, of which 106 are cities and “the rest are states, counties or other units of government.”
Supporters of sanctuary communities say that people who are here illegally but have not posed a danger to others or had trouble with police should not be turned over to immigration authorities.
Some police and town officials further argue that working with immigration officials will make people fearful of turning to them if they are the victim of a crime or have information about one.
“It’s incredibly disappointing to see cities and counties scaling back so-called ""sanctuary"" policies, which were largely adopted to further public safety and ensure immigrants weren’t afraid to call the police,” Grace Meng, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, told Fox News.
Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, predicted many more communities will be dropping or dramatically modifying their sanctuary stances.
“We’re going to see more of this,” Mehlman told Fox News. “Faced with the possibility of losing federal dollars, they’ll choose to keep funding public services rather than protecting illegal aliens.”",negative

A WAY OUT FOR TRUMP ON REFUGEE BAN
Henry Clay’s famous line was “I’d rather be right than be president.”
But what do you do when it’s the other way around?
President Trump wasted no time in issuing an ALL CAPS declaration that he would fight the ruling by judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals blocking implementation of his ban on all refugees and new visitors from seven troubled countries.
We are already two weeks into this struggle and we haven’t even gotten to the merits of the case yet. The brand new administration seems poised for a long, grueling legal fight over an order that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said was poorly implemented a position that Trump himself reportedly shares.
The problem with the rollout was language in the original order that seemed to apply the ban to those already granted permanent legal residency in the U.S. as well as those already vetted and cleared for visas.
In the face of the ensuing uproar, the administration shifted saying that the policy would not apply to green card holders, regardless of the actual language.
This leaves the president with a choice, and not a happy one for a politician who prides himself on winning, winning, winning: Trump can either make sure that his overall policy priorities are pursued and admit temporary defeat, or he can make good on his pledge to “SEE YOU IN COURT.”
Trump supporters no less staunch than Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas are encouraging the president to take a different path. As Gohmert counseled this morning on “FOX & Friends,” Trump should dump the original order and reissue a new one that doesn’t “apply to people that already had their green cards.”
Certainly there would be new lawsuits for a new order, but legal experts from across the political spectrum agree that eliminating the green card language would make the measure hard to beat. By focusing instead on the president’s enormous powers to restrict the entry of foreigners for national security reasons, Trump would help his political case as well.
But, as Trump’s team has pointed out in relation to other matters, settling a lawsuit can carry the appearance of an admission of guilt. And in this case, pulling the existing order and writing a new one would be tantamount to a settlement.
So what?
Over the course of the next four years, this administration like all those that came before it, will be party to a mountain of legal actions. It will not win them all.
Trump and his supporters claim that the decisions against the ban have been political. Maybe. But Trump’s predecessor, a darling of the press and a self-styled constitutional expert, got his hand slapped plenty of times in court.
If Barack Obama got turned back even by Supreme Court justices he appointed on major issues of executive authority, including on immigration, we can expect the same or worse for Trump.
Trump has already done what Henry Clay could not and become president. But like every president, there will be many times that he is not right, often through little fault of his own.
Successful presidencies are defined by the chief executive’s ability to remedy their errors and move on.

LAT: “The children were going to die. Mohamed Bzeek knew that. But in his more than two decades as a foster father, he took them in anyway — the sickest of the sick in Los Angeles County’s sprawling foster care system. He has buried about 10 children. Some died in his arms. Now, Bzeek spends long days and sleepless nights caring for a bedridden 6-year-old foster girl with a rare brain defect. She’s blind and deaf. She has daily seizures. Her arms and legs are paralyzed. Bzeek, a quiet, devout Libyan-born Muslim who lives in Azusa, just wants her to know she’s not alone in this life. ‘I know she can’t hear, can’t see, but I always talk to her,’ he said. ‘I’m always holding her, playing with her, touching her. …She has feelings. She has a soul. She’s a human being.’ …Of the 35,000 children monitored by the county’s Department of Children and Family Services, there are about 600 children at any given time who fall under the care of the department’s Medical Case Management Services…There is a dire need for foster parents to care for such children. And there is only one person like Bzeek.”

FLYNN WALKS BACK CLAIM HE DIDN’T TALK SANCTIONS WITH RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR
NYT: “Weeks before President Trump’s inauguration, his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, discussed American sanctions against Russia, as well as areas of possible cooperation, with that country’s ambassador to the United States, according to current and former American officials. Throughout the discussions, the message Mr. Flynn conveyed to the ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak — that the Obama administration was Moscow’s adversary and that relations with Russia would change under Mr. Trump — was unambiguous and highly inappropriate, the officials said … Days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Vice President-elect Mike Pence also denied that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak. He said he had personally spoken to Mr. Flynn, who assured him that the conversation was an informal chat that began with Mr. Flynn extending Christmas wishes. … Despite Mr. Flynn’s earlier denials, his spokesman told the Post that ‘while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.’”
TRUMP DUMPED ON NUKE TREATY IN CALL TO PUTIN
Reuters: “In his first call as president with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump denounced a treaty that caps U.S. and Russian deployment of nuclear warheads as a bad deal for the United States, according to two U.S. officials and one former U.S. official with knowledge of the call. When Putin raised the possibility of extending the 2010 treaty, known as New START, Trump paused to ask his aides in an aside what the treaty was, these sources said. Trump then told Putin the treaty was one of several bad deals negotiated by the Obama administration, saying that New START favored Russia. Trump also talked about his own popularity, the sources said.”

BIPARTISAN CALL FOR ETHICS OFFICE TO CHIDE CONWAY
The Hill: “The two top lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee on Thursday called on the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to recommend disciplinary action against White House counselor Kellyanne Conway for publicly promoting Ivanka Trump's clothing line. In a letter to OGE Director Walter Shaub Jr., Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and ranking democrat Elijah Cummings (Md.) said Conway's comments appeared to be an example of the White House counselor using her government office to endorse the personal business of President Trump's daughter. Conway provoked controversy earlier Thursday when, in a Fox News appearance, she urged viewers to ‘go buy Ivanka's stuff’ in response to retailer Nordstrom dropping the clothing after citing poor sales…Cummings wrote a letter to Chaffetz shortly afterward, calling on the Oversight Committee to refer Conway’s comments to the OGE for disciplinary action. Chaffetz said soon after that the counselor’s remarks were ‘clearly over the line.’”

“I have had a copy of the Princeton University copy of [“On Bull***t” by Harry Frankfurt] for many years and carry it with me to all business meetings. Does seem to keep discussions on point.” – Frank Siegler, Farmington, Minn.

“It seems to me that; notwithstanding the legal issues surrounding the Presidential Order, the President is still in control of the issuances of all visas. Can’t he simply instruct the Secretary of State to change the criteria for issuance of visas and or green cards to a new & more stringent administrative standard immediately?” – Bob Manuel, Indian Land, S.C.
[Ed. note: As discussed above, the issue isn’t about the issuance of new visas as much as it is about individuals already granted permanent legal residence. Not even Trump’s staunchest critics would say that the State Department lacks the authority to establish new vetting protocols. But it is a matter of great dispute whether the president can, even temporarily, block the travel of a class of individuals who have already completed the process and been granted green cards.]

Sacramento Bee: “It’s come to this: America’s crash-test dummies are getting older and fatter. In an effort to more accurately reflect the U.S. car-driving population, at least one manufacturer is making crash-test dummies – the pretend people used to test automobile safety features – bigger and older. ‘The typical patient today is overweight or obese – they’re the rule rather than the exception,’ said Dr. Stewart Wang, director of the University of Michigan International Center for Automotive Medicine, in a statement…The new crash-test models include a 273-pound dummy, more than 100 pounds heavier than normal, as well as a prototype based on an overweight 70-year-old woman. ‘The condition, size and shape of an individual is hugely important in how severe their injuries are in any given crash,’ said Wang, who has studied crash injuries and works with automotive engineers on safety research.”

164,"President Trump vowed Friday to take “additional security” steps next week to keep the country safe while his administration fights in court to reinstate the controversial travel ban for residents of seven mostly Muslim countries – a case he voiced confidence the U.S. government will win.
“I have no doubt that we’ll win that particular case,” Trump said at the White House, during a press conference alongside visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Without going into detail, Trump previewed additional measures he apparently plans to announce next week.
“We’ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country,” Trump said.
After the administration's latest court defeat late Thursday, some have urged Trump to simply rescind and rewrite the executive order at the center of the case. The controversial measure suspended the U.S. refugee program as well as travel and immigration for residents of seven countries in the Middle East and Africa.
Trump gave no indication at Friday’s press conference whether he was considering this step, saying only that they’d continue to work through the court process – and do “whatever is necessary” to protect the country.
The Justice Department is weighing its options, which also include appealing to a broader panel of judges or the Supreme Court.
The decision Thursday was made by a panel of three judges with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco.
In their unanimous decision, the judges refused to reinstate Trump's immigration order and rejected the government’s position that such presidential decisions on immigration policy are “unreviewable.”
“There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,” the judges wrote. “…Although our jurisprudence has long counseled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution.”
The decision does not end the court fight, but marked another setback in the president’s bid to suspend certain programs to examine how the U.S. can better vet those seeking admission to the country.
Trump and Abe left Washington on Air Force One Friday afternoon for a trip to Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. Trump and Abe are scheduled to play golf in south Florida on Saturday.
Earlier Friday, Abe touted the role of Japanese businesses in supporting thousands of jobs in the U.S. Speaking at the Chamber of Commerce, Abe said that ""a whopping majority"" of the Japanese cars running on American roads are manufactured in the U.S. by American workers.
Trump has criticized Toyota Motor Corp. for planning to build an assembly plant in Mexico and complained that Japanese consumers don't buy enough U.S.-made cars. Abe said it was an honor to be meeting Trump less than a month after his inauguration, showing the ""unwavering alliance"" between the two countries.
Trump also affirmed the U.S.-Japan alliance in his opening remarks Friday, calling it the “cornerstone of peace and stability” in the Pacific region. He stressed the importance of investing “heavily” in their defensive capabilities.

165,"President Donald Trump told China President Xi Jinping the U.S. would honor the “one China” policy months after Trump suggested he might use American policy on Taiwan as a bargaining chip between the two sides.
Trump “agreed at the request of President Xi,” to honor the policy, the White House said in a statement late Thursday.
President @realDonaldTrump and President Xi Jinping of China had a lengthy telephone conversation tonight. The two leaders discussed... pic.twitter.com/5QvtKAjflU — Dan Scavino Jr. (@Scavino45) February 10, 2017
The one China policy had been a source of friction between the U.S. and China since Trump’s election in November. Trump had questioned Washington’s policy on Taiwan, which shifted diplomatic recognition from self-governing Taiwan to China in 1979. He said it was open to negotiation.
China bristled at the comments Trump made. Trump told The Wall Street Journal in January that “everything is under negotiation, including ‘one China.’” The interview indicated at the time that Trump intended to shake up the relationship between Washington and Beijing, particularly on Taiwan.
Beijing was initially rattled over Trump’s call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, the first time an American president or president-elect had publicly spoken to Taiwan’s leader in nearly four decades.
Trump then said in a television interview that he didn't feel ""bound by a one China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.""
Chinese media also went on the attack after Trump’s one China policy comments, calling the then-president-elect “as ignorant as a child.” The Global Times published a Chinese-language editorial headlined: ""Trump, please listen clearly: 'One China' cannot be traded.""
The White House sought to break the ice with China, saying Wednesday Trump wrote to President Xi wishing the Chinese people greetings for the new year and the Lantern Festival.
""President Trump stated that he looks forward to working with President Xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China,"" the statement said.
China said it appreciated Trump’s holiday greeting. When asked if Xi felt snubbed that Trump called other world leaders, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, “This kind of remark is meaningless.”
Up until Wednesday, Trump had been the only U.S. president in recent years not to have issued greetings when the holiday fell on Jan. 28, triggering speculation in China as to whether it was an oversight or an intentional slight.

166,"President Trump got to work early Friday picking apart a federal court’s decision not to reinstate his controversial travel ban, noting that the detailed 29-page order did not include one mention of the statute he claims gives him broad authority on immigration.
“A disgraceful decision!” Trump tweeted, while quoting an analyst who flagged the omission in a Lawfare blog post.
The writer, Brookings fellow and Lawfare editor-in-chief Benjamin Wittes, had noted the order skipped over a key part of the U.S. code on “inadmissible aliens” which Trump had publicly recited on Wednesday in defense of his immigration restrictions.
READ THE COURT ORDER
The statute reads in part: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.”
Wittes wrote that this statute speaks to one of two “big questions” on which the case will turn.
He said the statute indeed gives Trump “sweeping power” to restrict entry, writing: “Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this statute, which forms the principal statutory basis for the executive order (see Sections 3(c), 5(c), and 5(d) of the order). That’s a pretty big omission over 29 pages, including several pages devoted to determining the government’s likelihood of success on the merits of the case.”
The Trump administration has pointed to that statute for days in defending the controversial move to suspend refugee admissions as well as travel and immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries.
CLINTON TROLLS TRUMP
A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, though, declined to lift a lower-court ruling that suspended the policy on other grounds.
In their unanimous decision, the judges generally referred to the government’s position that such presidential decisions on immigration policy are “unreviewable” – but rejected that argument.
“There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,” the judges wrote. “…Although our jurisprudence has long counseled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution.”
The ruling did address what Wittes said was the other “big” question at play: How statements from the president and his campaign team could “render an otherwise valid exercise of this power invalid.”
This aspect pertains to past statements by Trump and his advisers that they were looking at ways to suspend immigration to the U.S. for Muslims. While the administration now insists this is not a “Muslim” ban, the states challenging the order say it violates the establishment and equal protection clauses of the Constitution because it was meant to target Muslims – pointing to the president’s past statements and other factors.
The court wrote: “The States’ claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions.”
The Justice Department is now reviewing its options -- which include the possibility of appealing the matter to the Supreme Court, asking for a review from a broader panel of judges or taking the dispute back to the lower court. Or the White House could issue a revised order.
Trump tweeted overnight, “SEE YOU IN COURT,” without specifying which court.
Wittes argued that the 9th Circuit was right to leave the restraining order in place, “for the simple reason that there is no cause to plunge the country into turmoil again while the courts address the merits of these matters over the next few weeks.”
Before the measure was put on hold, Trump’s order caused chaos at airports amid confusion over which travelers were affected. Green-card holders initially were thought to be included in the freeze, though the Homeland Security Department later made clear they were exempt.
Wittes cautioned in his post that the fight over the merits is different than the battle that just played out in San Francisco: “Eventually, the court has to confront the clash between a broad delegation of power to the President—a delegation which gives him a lot of authority to do a lot of not-nice stuff to refugees and visa holders—in a context in which judges normally defer to the president, and the incompetent malevolence with which this order was promulgated.”",negative
167,"Although President Trump said he is convinced that his travel ban will eventually win in court, he said Friday that he is considering crafting a “brand new order.""
He said any action would not come until next week, but he stressed that “we need speed for reasons of security.”
The comments, which were made on Air Force One, suggest that he is going to take bifurcated strategy, according to The Wall Street Journal. In that case, his administration could continue a legal fight for his first order all while crafting another.
“I have no doubt that we’ll win that particular case,” Trump said at the White House, during a press conference alongside visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The Justice Department is weighing its options, which also include appealing to a broader panel of judges or the Supreme Court.

The initial order, which was signed Jan. 27, suspended entry for visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries for at least 90 days and froze the entire U.S. refugee program, The Journal reported.
Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston, said the ""million-dollar question"" is whether the Trump administration would appeal to the Supreme Court.
That could run the risk of having only eight justices to hear the case, which could produce a tie and leave the lower-court ruling in place.
""There's a distinct risk in moving this too quickly,"" Blackman said. ""But we're not in a normal time, and Donald Trump is very rash. He may trump, pardon the figure of speech, the normal rule.""

168,"Some call it a witch-hunt. Others say it’s a much-needed reality check.
President Trump, who during his campaign frequently spoke of illegal immigrants who had murdered Americans, has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to publish a public weekly list of criminal actions committed by people in the U.S. illegally.
Trump also instructed the agency to make public each week the localities that are not working with immigration officials by turning illegal immigrants in their custody over for deportation proceedings.
The order said it was intended “To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions.”
Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican who has been one of Congress’ most vocal and persistent proponents of strict immigration policies, lauded the new orders.
“We’ll be able to build an updated spreadsheet of their [DHS’] activities, arrests and deportations,” said King, who long has pushed for more public data on crimes committed by immigrants. “I’m delighted. This is sunshine on the government.”
King says he hopes to see “a full picture on how many illegal aliens are encountered by law enforcement” and he would like to see it include misdemeanors as well as more serious crimes.
Advocates seeking more lenient immigration policies likened the order to a witch hunt. They said that Trump is demonizing all illegal immigrants by portraying them as criminals.
“Trump wants to lift up stories of crimes because he wants the American people to think that most undocumented immigrants are criminals,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a Washington D.C.-based organization that favors less restrictive immigration laws. “Every expert knows the opposite is true, but he wants to spread the ‘Big Lie’ to justify what he intends to do -- which is to try to force millions of immigrants out of the country.”
Those who favor strict immigration enforcement are lauding the order, saying that cracks in the system that have allowed immigrants to commit crimes, including murder, after they have been deported and returned must be underscored and fixed.
“These provisions of the executive order enhance transparency and public safety and are long-overdue,” said Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which is based in Washington. “Under the Obama Administration, data regarding illegal alien crime was either non-existent, withheld or conflated.
“Collecting and publishing accurate information on illegal alien crime is a necessary and rightful obligation of government,” Dane said. “It allows us to get the full picture so that we can make meaningful policy in the public interest based on empirical evidence, not political spin.”
What is unclear is whether names will be published along with the crimes committed, and whether the list will include only serious felonies or low-level crimes as well.
White House Director of Media Affairs Helen Aguirre Ferré referred those questions to the Department of Homeland Security.
Gillian M. Christensen, the acting press secretary for DHS, said in an email to FoxNews.com in response to such questions: ""We’re not getting into a lot of the specifics right now.”
Trump made cracking down on illegal immigrants and beefing up border security a major part of his presidential campaign. He has proposed deporting 11 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. and building a massive wall along the country’s southern border with Mexico.
On the opening day of the Republican National Convention last summer, delegates who were gathered to cast their vote for the presidential nominee heard from family members of people killed by illegal immigrants.
“My son’s life was taken by an illegal alien,” said one of the speakers, Mary Mendoza, whose son Brandon, a police officer in Arizona, was killed by an illegal immigrant who was driving while intoxicated. “It’s time we have an administration that cares more about Americans than illegals.”
She added: “A vote for Hillary [Clinton] puts all of our lives at risk. It’s time for Donald Trump.”
Trump has held up crimes by illegal immigrants as an example of the dangers of a large population that lives in the shadows, and whose criminal histories are unknown. One of the most high-profile crimes by an undocumented immigrant in recent years was the murder in 2015 in San Francisco of Kathryn Steinle. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant who was charged with her murder, illegally re-entered the United States several times after being deported.
Immigration attorney Marty Rosenbluth, who practices in North Carolina, said the Trump administration is casting a wide net when it speaks about criminals.
“The categories for criminal are so broad,” Rosenbluth told Fox News. Rosenbluth added that information about immigrants who have committed crimes already is compiled.
“That data-sharing never ended,” he said. The goal seems to be, he said, “to shame localities” and cast a pall over immigrants.",negative

Abe, a nationalist adept at forging relationships with self-styled strongmen overseas, was the only world leader to meet the Republican before his inauguration. He is now the second to do so since Trump took office. Flattering the billionaire businessman, Abe said he would welcome the United States becoming ""even greater.""
He also invited Trump to visit Japan this year. Trump accepted, according to a joint statement.

They dined with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft at the club Friday night. Trump and Abe are scheduled to play golf Saturday.
Stepping carefully into Japan's longstanding territorial dispute with China over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, Trump said the U.S. is committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control. The implication was that the U.S.-Japan defense treaty covers the disputed islands, which Japan which calls the Senkaku, but China calls the Diaoyu.
Beijing opposes such statements, but Trump's wording allowed for some diplomatic wiggle room. The joint statement released later was more explicit, however, in spelling out the U.S. commitment.
Abe has championed a more active role for Japan's military. He has eased constraints imposed by the nation's pacifist post-war constitution and allowed forces to defend allies, even if Japan itself is not under attack.
There was less agreement on economics.
One of Trump's first actions as president was to withdraw the U.S. from a 12-nation, trans-Pacific trade agreement that was negotiated by the Obama administration and strongly supported by Tokyo.
Diverting from Trump's stance that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is bad for America, Abe stressed the importance of a ""free and fair common set of rules"" for trade among the world's most dynamic economies.
""That was the purpose of TPP. That importance has not changed,"" Abe said through an interpreter, though both leaders held out the possibility of a future bilateral, U.S.-Japanese deal.
Trump has also criticized Toyota Motor Corp. for planning to build an assembly plant in Mexico and has complained Japanese don't buy enough U.S.-made cars — though on Friday, Japanese government spokesman Norio Maruyama said Trump expressed appreciation to Abe for Japanese investment in the U.S. and looked forward to it expanding.
Abe told U.S. business leaders Friday that ""a whopping majority"" of the Japanese cars running on American roads are manufactured in the U.S. by American workers. That includes 70 percent of Toyotas. Abe said Japanese business supports some 840,000 jobs in the United States.
That may not be enough for Trump, who is highly sensitive to U.S. trade deficits.
Japan logged the second-largest surplus with the U.S. last year, behind only China, and there had been some expectation Abe would use the visit to propose new Japanese investments to help Trump spur American job growth. There was no such announcement Friday — only agreement to launch a high-level dialogue on economic cooperation.

171,"White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said Friday that President Trump has her back, amid a controversy over comments she made promoting Ivanka Trump’s fashion line.
The Associated Press reported earlier Friday that Trump backed Conway publicly and privately after House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, criticized her promotional remarks and urged the Office of Government Ethics to review the matter.
Conway, appearing on ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" said the president ""backs me 100 percent...he understands the fire we all take here.""
White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Conway had been ""counseled"" on her comments.
POTUS supports me, and millions of Americans support him & his agenda. https://t.co/FTaPXTymGV — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) February 10, 2017
Conway tweeted Friday: “POTUS supports me, and millions of Americans support him & his agenda.”
Conway on Thursday night also told Fox News’ “The First 100 Days” that Trump “supports me 100 percent.”
A White House spokeswoman said that while Trump didn't see Conway's television comments urging people to buy Ivanka Trump's products, he believed she was ""merely sticking up"" for his daughter after Nordstrom dropped her brand.
Earlier this week, Trump blasted Nordstrom on Twitter, claiming his daughter had been treated “unfairly” by the high-end retailer. The tweet prompted complaints from ethics experts, but Conway’s comments, at the end of an interview Thursday morning with “Fox & Friends,” quickly escalated into a bigger controversy.
In the interview, Conway lamented Ivanka Trump’s treatment in the business world and said: “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff … It’s a wonderful line, I own some of it. … I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.”
Chaffetz, not typically critical of the Trump administration, told the AP that Conway's actions were ""wrong, wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable.""
The Utah congressman and the ranking Democrat on the committee, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, jointly asked for the ethics review. The duo said Conway’s statements “appear to violate federal ethics regulations,"" adding that “Conway’s statements from the White House using her official title could appear to constitute an explicit endorsement for Ivanka Trump’s personal business activities.”
The Office of Government Ethics advises federal employees on such issues but is not an enforcement agency.
While Trump and Vice President Pence are not subject to ethical regulations and laws for federal employees, Conway is. Among the rules: An employee shall not use his or her office ""for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise.""
But because Conway reports only to Trump, it could be up to him to punish her for any ethics infraction and that seems unlikely.
In addition to the House Oversight Committee, two liberal-funded government watchdog groups pounced on Conway's comments, filing ethics violation complaints with OGE. A third group, the Project on Government Oversight, asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to open a Justice Department investigation.
Nordstrom reiterated that its decision to drop Ivanka Trump's brand was based on its performance, not politics. The company said sales of her items had steadily declined over the past year, particularly in the last half of 2016, ""to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now.""
While Ivanka Trump has handed over management of her company while she is in Washington, like her father, she retains ownership of it.

Trump kept up the barrage Thursday afternoon, telling reporters Gorsuch's ""comments were misrepresented, and what you should do is ask Sen. Blumenthal about his Vietnam record, that didn't exist after years of saying it did...he misrepresented that just like he misrepresented Judge Gorsuch.""
Asked to comment Thursday about the tweets, Blumenthal told Fox News ""this isn't about me"" and denied embellishing or misrepresenting his meeting with Gorsuch.
Blumenthal received five deferments, from 1965-1970, before enlisting in the Marine Corps Reserve, though he was never sent out of the U.S. During his six years in the Reserve, Blumenthal was stationed in Washington, focusing on a slew of local projects, such as a Toys for Tots drive.
During his political career, however, Blumenthal frequently walked a precarious line, often framing his service just ambiguously enough to give the impression that he had spent time fighting in Vietnam.
“I served during the Vietnam era,” Blumenthal said in 2008. “I remember the taunts, the insults, sometimes even physical abuse.”
He told a gathering of families who were expressing support for returning American troops in 2003 that, “when we returned, we saw nothing like this.”
Blumenthal, however, crossed the line when speaking to a group of veterans in March 2008.
“We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam,” he said.
The New York Times published those quotes and others in a bombshell report during the 2010 campaign, noting that Blumenthal was described as having served in Vietnam in at least eight Connecticut newspaper articles published between 2003 and 2009.
Linda McMahon, the Republican who ultimately opposed Blumenthal in 2010, claimed her campaign had leaked the tip about Blumenthal to The Times. McMahon is currently Trump’s nominee to lead the Small Business Administration.
Speaking with The Times in 2010, Blumenthal said he couldn’t recall if he had seen the articles and wasn’t sure if any steps had been taken to correct the claims.
“I don’t know if we tried to do so or not,” he said.
During a 2010 press conference in which he was surrounded by veterans, Blumenthal claimed he had “misspoken.”
“On a few occasions, I have misspoken about my service, and I regret that and I take full responsibility,” said Blumenthal, who explained he meant to say he served “during” Vietnam, not “in” Vietnam. “But I will not allow anyone to take a few misplaced words and impugn my record of service to our country.”

174,"President Donald Trump has issued belated well-wishes to China for the Lunar New Year, the most important holiday in the world's most populous nation, saying he hoped to work with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to build a ""constructive relationship.""
Trump had been the only U.S. president in recent years not to have issued greetings when the holiday fell on Jan. 28, triggering speculation in China as to whether it was an oversight or an intentional slight.
A statement from the White House late Wednesday said Trump wrote to Chinese President Xi Jinping wishing the Chinese people greetings for the new year and the Lantern Festival that falls on Saturday.
""President Trump stated that he looks forward to working with President Xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China,"" the statement said.
China said it appreciated Trump’s holiday greeting. When asked if Xi felt snubbed that Trump called other world leaders, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, “This kind of remark is meaningless.”
Trump has accused Beijing of unfair trade practices and currency manipulation, criticized China's military buildup in the South China Sea and accused Beijing of doing too little to pressure neighbor North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.
He also upended four decades of diplomatic protocol by speaking by phone with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory.
Beijing decried the phone call with Tsai and has rejected the other accusations. China has in fact been spending heavily from its pile of foreign currency reserves to prop up the value of its currency, which would make its exports less competitive.
Nick Bisley, an international relations expert at La Trobe University in Australia said Trump’s decision not to call Beijing is a sign of “bad times” ahead.
“China is very much being lined up by Trump’s people as not quite enemy number one but something approximating that,” Bisley said.
The prospect of a military confrontation over the South China Sea had also been raised by Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon when he hosted the conservative Breitbart News Daily radio show in 2015 and 2016.
Bannon said he envisioned the possibility of a U.S.-China war over the strategic waterbody within five to 10 years. China, which claims the sea virtually in its entirety, has been building man-made islands in the area and equipping them with airstrips and military installations.
Despite Trump's confrontational image, Chinese internet users were warmed by a brief video clip of Donald Trump's granddaughter singing in Chinese that circulated on the web earlier this month.

175,"President Trump on Thursday took aim at one of his favorite political targets – fellow Republican, Sen. John McCain – after McCain questioned the success of a military raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL.
McCain had said in a Wednesday statement that he “would not describe any operation that results in the loss of American life as a success.” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later fired back, saying “anyone who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and [does] a disservice,” but didn’t mention McCain by name. Trump, however, held nothing back.
“Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy! He’s been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in – bogged down in conflict all over the place,” Trump wrote in a series of morning tweets. “Our hero Ryan died on a winning mission (according to [Secretary of Defense] General Mattis), not a ‘failure.’ Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again!”
While the military reported taking a trove of information following the Jan. 29 nighttime raid on an Al Qaeda compound, Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens was killed and three other troops were wounded. U.S. forces also were forced to destroy an MV-22 Osprey aircraft after a “hard landing.”
""Several of [the Trump tweets] cracked me up,"" McCain said later Thursday. ""I can't comment on what the president does and I won't, but one of the things I've learned over the years here -- frankly, one of the guys I learned this from was Ted Kennedy -- he said you can ferociously defend your position or take the offense, but not get personal and you can move onto another issue or move on.
""I've tried to move on in the senate. I haven't always succeeded because of my temper, but generally speaking...I love to argue this...people I disagree with, I just don't get personal with it.""
But while McCain didn't take on the president directly, several Democratic senators jumped to the Arizona Republican's defense on Thursday.
""When President Trump assaults Senator McCain, he better watch out,"" said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla. ""Because this is a guy who knows what he's talking about and not only has he walked his talk, he's been there. And that's a dangerous area for president trump to continue to trash John McCain.""
Trump has frequently attacked McCain, a moderate GOP legislator who often has been critical of the president.
The war of words began when Trump said in July 2015 that McCain, who was a prisoner during the Vietnam war, was “not a war hero.”
“He was a war hero because he was captured,” Trump said. “I like people who weren’t captured.”
Trump quickly followed that controversy by lambasting McCain for problems at the VA. In October 2016, as Trump was being pilloried after a decade-old audio surfaced that featured Trump making crude remarks, Trump hit McCain for not supporting him.
“The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!” Trump tweeted Oct. 11.
When Trump’s executive order temporarily restricting immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries drew a rebuke from McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, Trump again took to Twitter.
“The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong – they are sadly weak on immigration,” he wrote. “The two Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.”

176,"President Trump on Thursday struck back at Sen. Richard Blumenthal a day after the Connecticut Democrat leaked alleged details of a conversation he had with Trump’s Supreme Court pick.
Blumenthal on Wednesday told reporters that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch said previous comments made by Trump about a federal judge were “demoralizing” and “disheartening.”
“Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?” Trump tweeted.
He later added: ""Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave 'service' in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!""
The supposed comments from Gorsuch to Blumenthal came in response to Trump’s tweet calling a federal judge a “so-called judge.” That judge had suspended Trump’s immigration restriction executive order.
But White House sources told Fox News that, while Gorsuch had indeed used the words ""disheartening"" and ""demoralizing"" during his meeting with Blumenthal, he was not specifically talking about Trump's public spat with the federal judge, and was instead speaking in generalities about attacks on the judiciary.
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway wouldn't comment on whether Trump and Gorsuch had spoken in the past day, however, she told ""Fox & Friends"" on Thursday that ""the president is fully confident in Judge Gorsuch.""
Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is aiding Gorsuch as he speaks with senators, released a statement Thursday morning clarifying the comments Gorsuch made to Blumenthal.
""Judge Gorsuch has made it very clear in all of his discussions with senators, including Senator Blumenthal, that he could not comment on any specific cases and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters,"" Ayotte said. ""He has also emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary, and while he made clear that he was not referring to any specific case, he said that he finds any criticism of a judge's integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.”
Trump in his tweet latched on to Blumenthal’s history of embellishment to bolster his case that the Senate Judiciary Committee member had misrepresented Gorsuch’s remarks.
Blumenthal had for years boasted of having “served in Vietnam,” but had in actuality received five deferments, from 1965-1970, before he joined the Marine Reserve, The New York Times reported in 2010 when Blumenthal first ran for Senate. Blumenthal’s position in the Marine Reserve sent him to Washington state – thousands of miles from Asia – where he focused on local tasks, such as organizing a Toys for Tots drive.
“We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam,” Blumenthal told a group of veterans in 2008, according to The Times.
Blumenthal told The Times he had misspoken, saying his “intention has always been to be completely clear and accurate and straightforward, out of respect to the veterans who served in Vietnam.”

The orders came as Trump attended the swearing-in ceremony of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was confirmed by the Senate Wednesday night.
The orders establish three Department of Justice task forces to fight drug cartels, reduce violent crime and reduce attacks against police. The White House did not immediately release copies of the orders.
Trump said he was seeking “to break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth.” The cartel task force would partner the DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security.
Law and order was a central theme of Trump’s campaign, during which he also pushed his hardline immigration policies. But he has also prioritized tackling violent crime, recently promising on Twitter that if Chicago didn’t get its crime problem under control, he would “send in the Feds.”

WHITE HOUSE FIRES BACK AT IMMIGRATION ORDER CRITICS WITH LIST OF TERROR ARRESTS
Miller spoke hours after the White House released a list of terrorism cases involving suspects who came to the U.S. from the seven countries mentioned in the order: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
""We’ve seen example after example ... of individuals becoming radicalized and joining terrorist groups,"" Miller said. ""The reality ... is that it is a daily feature of life for law enforcement officials and federal investigators all across this country to be investigating, interdicting and preventing terrorist acts that are only being conceived of ... because we let these individuals into our country in the first place.""
Miller also slammed U.S. District Court Judge James Robart's decision last week to issue a temporary restraining order, which halted the enforcement of Trump's executive order, as ""judicial activism.""
""An unelected judge does not have the right to remake the immigration laws and policies for the entire United States of America,"" Miller said.

179,"A group of hackers managed to breach Washington D.C.'s surveillance camera network and infect the system with ransomware days before President Trump's inauguration, law enforcement officials close to the investigation told Fox News.
The network of cameras affected eight days before President Trump was sworn in included ones located along the inaugural parade route, officials said Thursday.
Investigators were able to rid the system of ransomware without paying any money, and the network was fully operational on Inauguration Day.
An investigation into the ransomware attack is ongoing and being run by the Secret Service, officials said.
A separate law enforcement source described the cyber-attack to Fox News as emanating from overseas, and that investigators have not ruled out the possibility that this attack was carried out by a state sponsored actor.
The Washington Post was first to report on the network breach.
When a system is infected with ransomware, users are unable to access the system itself or information stored on that system unless some kind of digital ransom is paid. Hackers carrying out these types of attacks typically give infected users a time window to pay up, or risk having their system wiped.
There have been a string of ransomware attacks in recent years targeting individual users, as well as hospitals, private businesses, and municipalities across the country.",neutral
180,"Illegal immigrants need only one number to access billions of dollars in free taxpayer cash.
The Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) unlocks an exclusive gateway for non-citizens to receive monies meant for working, low-income Americans. The nine-digit code was created by bureaucrats in 1996 for foreigners who had to deal with the IRS. It allows people without a Social Security number, including those in the country illegally, to file taxes.
“It’s just a farce to say it was created to collect taxes,” Robert Rector, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News. “It’s nothing but a welfare program designed for illegal immigrants. ITINS are for tourists or illegals. No ITIN filer is eligible to work in the United States.”
The problem with ITIN, critics say, is gives non-citizens access to federal cash that they should not be entitled to receive. Once illegal immigrants file ITIN tax returns, they can apply for a Child Tax Credit – which entitles them to $1,000 per child. Unlike the Earned Income Tax Credit, which requires a Social Security Number to qualify, the Child Tax Credit is a cash program that does not.
Critics say that makes it ripe for abuse.
Numerous investigations by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration have chronicled not only improper Child Tax Credit fraud and error payments ranging from $5.9 billion to $7.1 billion, but schemes such as nearly 24,000 ITIN payments going to the same address. The audit reports also found IRS management was “not concerned with addressing questionable applications” but “interested only in the volume of applications that can be processed, regardless of whether they are fraudulent.”
Another audit report examining ITIN usage found Child Tax Credit claims more than quadrupled in five years, from $924 million in 2005 to $4.2 billion in 2010.
An agency spokesman said the IRS recently paid $5.7 billion to ITIN for those claiming child tax credit and in 2015 it paid $3.4 billion.
A Social Security number is required to qualify for any federal public benefit. Green card holders, refugees and those granted asylum receive Social Security Numbers. But workers without a Social Security Number can still file taxes – and apply for certain tax credits – with an ITIN number.
“If you don’t have a Social Security number, you shouldn’t be getting a tax payment,” David North of the Center for Immigration Studies told Fox News. “It keeps happening and nobody pays attention.”
Some are calling for President Trump to close the loophole and require people to obtain a Social Security number in order to receive a Child Tax Credit. North says no such course correction was included in an immigration-related draft order leaked to The Washington Post late January.
“The order overlooks one of the largest sources of payments to non-citizens,” North said. “The federal government should not be subsidizing people who are in this country illegally.”
North said the program has little oversight and abuse is not taken seriously.
“The Treasury Department is not careful who gets a number,” North said. Documents can be obtained through the mail, proving foreign status via a passport or combination of such documents as a VISA, foreign voter ID or school and medical records, without in-person interviews.
IRS IMPROPERLY PAID $15.6 BILLION THROUGH EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT PROGRAM
While congressional attempts to adjust the practice have sputtered, Indiana Congressman Luke Messer is resurrecting an effort to address the issue.
“After eight years of the Obama administration, it’s clear the law isn’t clear enough,” Messer told Fox News. “There is no policy reason why we should be supporting families who are here illegally.”
Messer’s proposal, H.R. 363, would ensure only taxpayers with a valid Social Security number are able to claim the Child Tax Credit.
He says his legislation will save America billions of dollars and “could be a method to pay for the wall.”
Messer says he hopes to package the law into congressional tax reform efforts but would “welcome an administrative fix.”
Rector concurs, saying Trump needs to step in and take action.
“An executive order could stop this immediately,” he said. “It violates welfare reform to make these payments to illegal immigrants.”",positive
181,"A defiant President Donald Trump tweeted “SEE YOU IN COURT” after a San Francisco federal appeals court Thursday upheld the suspension of his controversial immigration order.
He also warned the security of the nation was at stake and said he expected to easily win the case.
Top presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway told Martha MacCallum on “The First 100 Days” that she could not specify if Trump meant he would take it to the Supreme Court, but there were “different options” open to the White House.
She added that the ruling “does not affect the merits at all.”
The panel of three judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused to reinstate the order after a federal judge had issued a halt to it last week.
But the Justice Department said it is ""reviewing the decision and considering its options.” Trump later tweeted: ""SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!""
He also told the White House press pool shortly after the ruling, ""it's a political decision and we'll see them in court...it is a decision that we will win in my opinion very easily.""
Asked how he learned about the decision, Trump replied, ""we just saw it, just like you did.""
Trump issued the executive order, which placed a 90-day pause on immigrants from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan, on Jan. 27, causing chaos and outrage at airports across the country. The order also imposed a 120-day pause on all refugees, and an indefinite pause on refugees from Syria.
The case was given to the appeals court after a Seattle federal judge last week ordered a halt to Trump’s order. Judge James Robart issued a temporary restraining order after Washington state and Minnesota both sued.
Attorneys from the Justice Department appealed Robart’s ruling, arguing that the president’s executive power gives him the authority to place restrictions on people coming into the country.
However, the court ruling disagreed with that argument:
""In short, although courts owe considerable deference to the President’s policy determinations with respect to immigration and national security, it is beyond question that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action,"" the court ruled.
Supporters of Trump's order argue it will help keep America safe from terrorists looking to infiltrate the United States from terror hotspots that often have inadequate vetting procedures. Opponents have argued it is unconstitutional and discriminatory – claiming that it is a “Muslim ban” and that it has harmed individuals and businesses.
The court ruled that the government has not presented ""any evidence"" of a sufficient national security threat from the seven countries in question.
""...[The] Government has not offered any evidence or even an explanation of how the national security concerns that justified those designations, which triggered visa requirements, can be extrapolated to justify an urgent need for the Executive Order to be immediately reinstated.
The Democratic National Committee called the ruling a ""massive blow to the White House.
“Let’s be clear: This is a massive blow to the White House. The court upheld that we do not discriminate based on religion. That is what terrorists do, and what terrorists want us to do,"" Interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement.
The American Civil Liberties Union also praised the ruling.
""The government’s erratic and chaotic attempts to enforce this unconstitutional ban have taken a tremendous toll on innocent individuals, our country’s values, and our standing in the world,"" Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Projects, said in a statement. ""We will keep fighting this un-American executive order until it is permanently dismantled.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, called on Trump to abandon the order entirely.
""President Trump ought to see the handwriting on the wall that his executive order is unconstitutional. He should abandon this proposal, roll up his sleeves and come up with a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe,"" he said.
If the case goes to the Supreme Court, it appears Trump’s nominee for its vacant seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch, is unlikely to be in place by the time it reached the court. It is also possible that if it goes to the high court, by that time the temporary restrictions would have expired.
The administration could also ask a larger panel of judges to hear the appeal, or accept the order and go back to the Seattle-based federal court and try and block the next legal step -- whether to grant the states’ request for a preliminary injunction—which would put enforcement of the Executive Order on hold until all the appeals are exhausted.
During arguments before the court, Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued that Trump campaign statements about a Muslim ban showed discriminatory intent.
""There are statements that we've quoted in our complaint that are rather shocking evidence of intent to discriminate against Muslims, given that we haven't even had any discovery yet to find out what else might have been said in private,"" Purcell said.

183,"Letters to parents about school financial problems are nothing unusual, but one from the head of Chicago Public Schools has created a firestorm of criticism.
CPS CEO Forrest Claypool announced a $46 million spending freeze as well as other possible cuts, including one for $18 million for independently run schools. The letter was filled with pointed attacks on Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, whom Claypool lambasted for not doing more to give the district enough funding.
And in a move that particularly infuriated parents, and others, Claypool said that in neglecting Chicago schools, Rauner was acting like President Donald Trump.
“Just like Trump, he’s attacking children of immigrants, he’s attacking racial minorities, attacking the poor here in Chicago,” Claypool said in the letter, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. “In this case it’s children, which is particularly shameful.”
That was one of several references he made to Trump in his comparisons of the governor and the president. Claypool urged parents to reach out to Rauner’s office and tell the governor to “stop acting like President Trump” and to be fair to their children.
The criticism over the letter has been steadily pouring in, with parents, taxpayer groups and some educators calling the partisan political tone inappropriate.
Many also take Claypool to task for what they say is his move to punt to the state the problems that the school district itself – as well as city officials, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel -- helped create.
“Using partisan politics is not an effective way to build trust with Chicago public school parents and students,” said Sarah Brune, spokesperson for Illinois Campaign for Political Reform, a non-partisan organization that advocates for transparency and accountability in government. “Voters expect both public officials and employees to take a neutral stance on politics, particularly when it’s about a local issue.”
“There’s no reason to get national politics involved,” Brune told Fox News. “And the mixing of political opinions and work during city time makes people uncomfortable.”
Efforts to get a comment from CPS were unsuccessful.
The Sun-Times noted that Claypool and Emanuel have been taking shots at Rauner because of the governor’s veto of a bill that called for giving CPS $215 million for teacher pensions.
Troy LaRaviere, president of the Chicago Principals and Administrators Association, wrote a letter that appeared in the Chicago Tribune in which he challenged Claypool to take responsibility for CPS’s own role in creating a financial mess.
“While Rauner deserves his share of the blame for the state's failure to rescue our students from this perilous circumstance,” LaRaviere wrote, “it is not Rauner's mismanagement that brought us to this crisis. That responsibility lies with Claypool, his recent predecessors, the Chicago Board of Education — and Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who appointed them all.”
“They've had six years to get CPS out of this situation,” LaRaviere continued, “yet they continue to create financial chaos year after year and point the finger at Springfield for failing to rescue Chicago's children from the chaos they've created.”
Illinois Secretary of Education Beth Purvis was not pleased with Claypool’s letter, according to the Chicago Tribune.
“Why would CPS arbitrarily create a crisis and hurt its students and teachers rather than work to pass the Senate’s balanced budget reform package?” Purvis wrote to parents.",neutral

Trump tweeted the warning on the heels of a late-Tuesday hearing before the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where the Justice Department sought to persuade judges to restore Trump’s controversial executive order pausing refugee admissions and immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
A Seattle District Court judge halted the order last week, and lawyers for the Justice Department contended Tuesday that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter the United States.
Trump controversially weighed in on that decision multiple times on Twitter, calling Judge James Robart a ""so-called judge"" and accusing him of opening up the U.S. “to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart.”
Supporters of the order have said it will help keep America safe from terrorists looking to infiltrate the United States from terror hotspots that often have inadequate vetting procedures. Opponents have argued it is unconstitutional and discriminatory – claiming it is a “Muslim ban.”

186,"President Trump on Wednesday brought the legal dispute over his immigration executive order into the court of public opinion, using a Washington law enforcement address to mount an urgent defense of the measure and urge the federal courts to reinstate it.
At a meeting with local sheriffs and police chiefs, the president said he issued the immigration order “for the security of our nation, the security of our citizens, so that people come in who aren't going to do us harm.”
He spoke after a hearing late Tuesday during which the Justice Department presented its arguments to the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The DOJ is fighting to overturn a Seattle judge’s decision to halt the controversial order that suspended the U.S. refugee program and immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan. A decision could come at any time.
""We're in an area where, let's just say, they are interpreting things differently from probably 100 pecent of people in this room,"" Trump said.
Trump read out parts of the federal law outlining presidential powers on the subject, saying it was written clearly and ""beautifully.”
The part of the U.S. Code he read specifies that when the president ""finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation ... suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.""
“A bad high school student would understand this,” he said.
Trump said he listened to the judges Tuesday and, while vowing not to comment specifically on the hearing, said: ""I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful, it was disgraceful.""
Supporters of Trump's order say it will help keep America safe from terrorists looking to infiltrate the United States from terror hotspots that often have inadequate vetting procedures. Opponents have argued it is unconstitutional and discriminatory – claiming that it is a “Muslim ban.”
During Tuesday's hearing, Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued that Trump campaign statements about a Muslim ban showed discriminatory intent.
""There are statements that we've quoted in our complaint that are rather shocking evidence of intent to discriminate against Muslims, given that we haven't even had any discovery yet to find out what else might have been said in private,"" Purcell said.
Trump has waded into the legal battle before, largely on Twitter. He recently called the judge who halted the order, James Robart, a “so-called judge” and earlier Wednesday warned on Twitter that, “If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled.”
At the meeting with police chiefs, he indicated he would be ready to criticize the appeals court if it ruled against his administration.
""I don't ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased and we haven’t had a decision yet, but courts seem to be so political,"" he said. “It would be so great for our justice system if they were able to read a statement and do what’s right and that’s to do with the security of our nation, which is so important.”
He warned that until the issue was resolved, the nation's security would be at risk.
""I think it's sad, I think it's a sad day,"" he said. ""I think our security is at risk today and it will be at risk until such time as...we get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country.""

187,"Even as he signs executive orders at a furious pace and plans 'yuge' changes across the federal government, President Trump is dealing with a major disadvantage: His team is not in place.
Not only has the Senate confirmed just a handful of Trump's Cabinet nominees nearly three weeks into his presidency, but hundreds of other positions remain unappointed. Part of the problem is Trump has not named most of those mid-level nominees; and part, as Trump complained Tuesday night, is Senate Democrats' “obstruction” of his Cabinet picks.
But one thing is clear: this year's Cabinet confirmation process is one of the slowest in history.
As of Wednesday, Trump was still waiting on confirmation for 10 of his 15 Cabinet nominees. By this time in 2001, then-President George W. Bush had his entire Cabinet confirmed. Then-President Barack Obama was just three short of a full Cabinet on Feb. 8, 2009.
Senate Republican leaders asserted this week that -- based on numbers provided by the Partnership for Public Service, Plum Book, and Congress.gov -- Trump has the fewest Cabinet secretaries confirmed at this point in the presidency of any incoming president since George Washington.
While Trump is pressing ahead with his agenda on immigration, security and other issues, the slow pace of confirmations underscores the struggle his administration will continue to face in getting things done.
""It is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country. Obstruction by Democrats!"" Trump tweeted overnight, as the Senate prepared to vote on his nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for attorney general.
Trump is right that his Cabinet confirmation is facing historic delays. But the president also is expected to fill nearly 1,000 agency positions that require Senate confirmation.
CEO of the Partnership for Public Service Max Stier put the onus on Trump to put those nominations forward, telling Fox News “it begins with the executive.”
“Anyone may have reasonable complaints about Senate processes, but until the names are presented to the Senate, the ball is not in their court,” Stier explained. “The tendency is to compare to Obama or Bush or other past practice, but I don’t think any president has done this right.”
By this time in 2009, then-President Barack Obama had 24 nominees confirmed, including Cabinet and other positions. Trump has a total of seven in place, most of them Cabinet-level officials.
Stier told Fox News the next step for the Trump administration should be naming deputy secretaries for each agency. These officials are critical, he explained, as they play the role of ""chief operating officers"" throughout the government.
""It's critical they get put in place early enough to make these organizations run better and create good rhythm with the No. 1's,” Stier said. “If you think about this from the perspective of running an important organization or business, the idea that it could take over a year to fill key leadership spots is ridiculous.”
Yet in naming these deputy posts, it seems Trump so far is on track with his predecessors. As of Wednesday, Trump has named three: deputy secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security, and a deputy attorney general for the Justice Department. Obama also had named three deputies at this point.
“Deputy secretaries are more important than Cabinet-level positions and they take a long time to fill,” said UC Berkeley Law Professor Anne Joseph O’Connell, who tracks presidential appointees. “You can have a secretary without government experience, but if they are paired with a deputy who understands laws that apply to government and not corporations, it works well—It’s a counter-balancing of expertise.”
O’Connell said Trump’s Cabinet nominees, assuming they’re confirmed, have relatively little government experience.
“We have an initial Cabinet with very little government experience, so you really need the deputies to get these agencies up and running,” O’Connell said.
But O’Connell noted the delay for the nominees Trump has named could be, in part, due to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s 2013 filibuster overhaul. Those changes ostensibly made it easier for a new president to confirm nominees, but also made it easier for the minority to drag out the process.
“In terms of filling the initial Cabinet, President Trump is the first under these new rules,” O’Connell said.
O’Connell noted some of Trump’s agency appointees also have not finished bipartisan vetting through the Office of Government Ethics.
“The White House usually does much of its own vetting, but this administration is doing far too little and that’s contributing to the delay.”
Partisan tensions, though, also are running high.
On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that Trump had nominated “about the worst Cabinet” he had ever seen. Democrats can do little at this stage to block his nominees, however, and a series of votes is scheduled over the next week.
Obama’s full Cabinet was confirmed at the end of April 2009. But O’Connell thinks there is good news to come for Trump: “I predict President Trump will have his full Cabinet before President Obama.”",negative
188,"Day after day, on issue after issue, President Trump is stepping up his attacks on the media.
His lambasting of what he calls the “failing New York Times” has become a constant refrain on his Twitter feed, even edging out “fake news” CNN.
But as these battles consume more and more bandwidth—the media, of course, love to talk about themselves—this question emerges: Is this helping Trump push through his agenda?
Does the president’s signature counterpunching move the needle on the temporary immigration ban, replacing ObamaCare, cutting tax cuts and boosting infrastructure spending?
Or is it in danger of becoming background noise?
In a matter of days, Trump has called a Times report on staff turmoil “fiction,” lambasted “fake news” polls by CNN, NBC and ABC, and said the media are deliberately downplaying some terror attacks.
Just to be clear: The president and his people have every right to push back on what they view as unfair or inaccurate reporting. The Washington Post, as I reported, had to back off from a story claiming that Steve Bannon had marched over to Homeland Security and pressured its secretary into not issuing exemptions to the travel ban.
The Times especially gets under the president’s skin as his hometown paper, and his post-election praise of the paper as a “jewel” when he went to the newsroom is now a distant memory.
The NYT piece that drew the president’s ire said he and his team are “rethinking an improvisational approach to governing that mirrors his chaotic presidential campaign,” especially after the “bungled rollout” of the executive order on immigration.
On a more personal level, the story portrayed Trump as “cloistered” in the White House, lonely and isolated, watching too much TV, and wandering around at night in a bathrobe.
When Sean Spicer assailed the story as “riddled with inaccuracies and lies” and “literally the epitome of fake news,” he declared that “I don’t think the president owns a bathrobe, he definitely doesn’t wear one.” Good to know!
Spicer also denied that Trump wasn’t fully briefed on an order reorganizing the National Security Council and making Bannon a member. The paper says it stands by the story.
""The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources!""
Well, it wasn’t exactly fiction, since Spicer, Bannon, Chris Christie and others were quoted on the record. Trump attacked the paper again after one of the story’s authors, Maggie Haberman, appeared on CNN.
A number of news outlets have reported on staff infighting and Bannon’s considerable influence, but the Times, as Trump knows, is uniquely influential in setting the media agenda. Politico framed the reaction this way: “President Donald Trump on Monday lashed out via Twitter at a series of news reports revealing the turmoil inside the White House, leaning on his crutch of ‘fake news’ as he struggles to control a hardening narrative about a dysfunctional West Wing.”
Meanwhile, the president’s comments on the media and terrorism have set off another major skirmish.
After tweeting against the “so-called judge” who has temporarily blocked his travel ban, Trump spoke about ISIS at U.S. Central Command in Tampa: “You’ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it’s happening. It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported. And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.”
The Washington Post offered this take: “President Trump appears to be laying the groundwork to preemptively shift blame for any future terrorist attack on U.S. soil from his administration to the federal judiciary, as well as to the media… The president accused the media of failing to report on some terrorist attacks for what he implied were nefarious reasons.""
I was puzzled by Trump’s accusation. When a reporter asked about it at a photo op yesterday, the president said: “I understand the total dishonesty of the media better than anybody – I let people know.” He did add that “not everybody” is in this category.
The White House put out a list of 78 terror attacks, but these included the carnage in Paris, Nice, San Bernardino and Orlando, which drew saturation coverage.
Now it’s true that some attacks overseas, without mass casualties, draw far less coverage than those committed on U.S. soil. And the media move on more quickly these days as these attacks, tragically, have become more commonplace.
But most attacks draw plenty of coverage as public interest and fear surges amid the carnage. And the networks pushed back, with CBS saying it covered 74 percent of the attacks on the list, NBC saying it covered 57, and Anderson Cooper and Bill Hemmer saying they were on the ground for some of them.
Trump feels strongly that he has to combat a relentlessly negative media narrative. But he also shines a powerful spotlight on the stories he most detests and brings them to a much wider audience.",negative
189,"President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee said Wednesday that comments Trump made about the federal appeals court deliberating his travel ban were ""disheartening and demoralizing,"" Fox News has learned.
A source on the president's Supreme Court nomination team told Fox that Judge Neil Gorsuch made the remark in a meeting with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.
Blumenthal told reporters after the meeting that Gorsuch had ""expressed to me that he is disheartened by the demoralizing and abhorrent comments by president trump about the judiciary.""
Earlier Wednesday, Trump slammed the Ninth Cicuit Court of Appeals, which is currently deliberating his executive order temporarily suspending the country's refugee program and banning travel for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.
""Courts seem to be so political and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what's right,"" the president said in an address to a group of police chiefs and sheriffs. ""And that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important.""
Trump focused on the language used in a law detailing presidential powers to limit ""inadmissible aliens.""
The provision states that when a president finds that the entry of foreigners may be detrimental to U.S. interests, the president may ""suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.""
""It was written beautifully,"" Trump told the attendees, asserting that even ""a bad high school student would understand this.""
Trump tweeted about the order again in the afternoon.
Trump nominated Gorsuch Jan. 31 to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year.

190,"A Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday the Defense Department is looking to rent some space in Trump Tower for the “personnel and equipment who will support POTUS at this residence in the building.”
Lt. Col. J.B. Brindle told The Washington Post the DoD is “working through appropriate channels … to acquire a limited amount of leased space in Trump Tower.”
According to the newspaper, the space would be separate from the Secret Service detail that is already based at Trump Tower in New York City. Melania Trump and their son Barron still call Trump Tower home.
The possible move could raise ethical questions about a government agency paying rent to a company owned by Trump. The asking price for the department’s space hasn’t been released, but renting a floor at Trump Tower could reportedly cost nearly $1.5 million per year.
“I have never heard of a president charging rent to the DOD or any other part of the government so they can be near him on his travels,” former chief White House ethics counsel under George W. Bush told The Washington Post. “He should give them for free a very limited amount of space and they can rent nearby if needed.”
Barack Obama made similar arrangements during his presidency. Defense officials offered to support for Obama and his staff at his Chicago home.
Trump has already stepped down from several key roles in his businesses and left some of the operations of his firms to his children. He has yet to divest his financial stakes in his business interests.

Carter, a Democrat who was the first U.S. president to install solar panels at the White House, said he hoped the Republican Trump would give it ""deep consideration.""
""Sometimes there's a philosophical objection to this by some — I'll say right-wing Republicans — but he has a high priority of job creation,"" Carter said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""If they just remember the tremendous potential of creating millions of jobs in America just from renewable energy sources, that would be a very good counter-argument to those who oppose the concept of global warming being caused by human activity.""
Trump has sent mixed signals on whether he will try to slow Earth's warming temperatures and rising sea levels. During the transition, Trump met with prominent climate activists Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio, but he has also appointed oil industry champions who want to reverse President Barack Obama's efforts to rein in emissions.
The vast majority of peer-reviewed studies and climate scientists agree the planet is warming, mostly due to man-made sources. Under Obama, the U.S. dramatically ramped up production of renewable energy from sources such as solar, in part through Energy Department grants.
Carter, a former peanut farmer from southwest Georgia, on Wednesday celebrated the installation of solar panels on 10 acres of farmland he owns in Plains, where he and former first lady Rosalynn Carter grew up and still have a home.
Carter, who is 92, leased the land to Atlanta-based SolAmerica Energy, which owns, operates, and sells power generated from solar cells. The company estimates the project will provide more than half of the power needed in the town of 755 people.
""It shows what a small town can do, what one farmer can do,"" said Carter. ""It's also a very good source of income for farmers who can get as much as $500 per acre per year by allocating some of their land to solar panels.""",neutral
192,"California taxpayers are shelling out $25,000 a month for 40 hours of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder’s time to help the state strategize for upcoming clashes with the Trump administration, according to a contract obtained by a conservative watchdog group.
The California Legislature hired Holder and his Washington, D.C., firm, Covington & Burling, last month to assist with legal challenges over everything from immigration to environmental policies.
Judicial Watch, which obtained Holder’s contract through a records request, called the deal “crony corruption pure and simple.”
“The new records show California state legislators are wasting tax dollars to bankroll another corrupt politician – Eric Holder – under the pretense of attacking the Trump administration,” Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a written statement.
The firm did not respond to a request for comment.
On Tuesday, lawmakers paraded the former Obama administration official around the state capital, though they remained quiet on what exactly Holder would be helping them with. Holder himself was coy when asked about his role.
“I’m here just to assist these gentlemen and the people who they serve with in trying to protect the interests of the people of California,” Holder told reporters.
Asked how he was doing it, Holder responded, “Well.”
Holder had a closed-door meeting with Gov. Jerry Brown. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra joined in by phone, according to reports in The Los Angeles Times and Sacramento Bee.
Tuesday’s visit marked the first time Holder has come to the capital since his firm was hired last month as independent counsel.
Not all California lawmakers are on board with the hire. Assemblyman Kevin Kiley, a Republican, claims the three-month contract with Holder's firm is illegal.
In a letter to the opinion unit of the state attorney general’s office, Kiley contended that hiring Holder as outside counsel violates Article VII of the California Constitution.
Representatives for Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon and Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León – both Democrats -- said the legislature was exempt from rules that would apply to an executive agency.
Holder was one of former President Barack Obama’s longest-serving and most controversial Cabinet members.

193,"The speaker of Britain's House of Commons sparked a backlash Monday after announcing he does not want President Trump to address Parliament – with opponents accusing him of hypocrisy for having welcomed leaders from places like North Korea.
Prime Minister Theresa May had invited Trump to make a state visit to the U.K. during her own trip to Washington last month. While travel plans have not been set, such state visits sometimes include an address to both Houses of Parliament.
However, Speaker John Bercow, who is supposed to be politically neutral in his role, said Monday he would oppose an address from Trump, particularly due to “the migrant ban.”
“An address by a foreign leader to other houses of Parliament is not an automatic right, it is an earned honor,” he said. “After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump, I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.”
For an address to Parliament to occur, an invite must be issued by speakers from both Houses of Parliaments, as well as the Lord Great Chamberlain on behalf of the Queen.
“I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism, and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons,” he said.
While the speaker’s remarks were welcomed by left-wing politicians -- with Green Party MP Caroline Lucas praising him for stopping May from “pimping out Parliament” -- others were livid. Conservative MP John Whittingdale called Bercow’s speech “a performance.”
“It was John Bercow playing to the gallery and I think it was damaging to the national interest,” he told Sky News.
Bercow also faced accusations of hypocrisy. U.K. political blog Guido Fawkes noted that leaders from China, Kuwait, Indonesia and Singapore – all countries with poor human rights records – have been welcomed to address Parliament by Bercow.
“Bercow lavished praise on the human rights abusing leaders of Kuwait, Indonesia, Singapore and China, yet bans Trump to grab headlines,” the blog said.
Kuwait has no laws criminalizing domestic violence or marital rape, while homosexuality is punishable by seven years in prison, according to Human Rights Watch. Bercow introduced Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad Al-Sabah in 2012, calling it his ""privilege"" to welcome the emir to Parliament.
Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi said in a BBC interview that the invite to the Kuwait emir ""exposes him to the accusation of hypocrisy"" in the wake of his Trump statement.
Guido Fawkes also linked to a government document showing that in 2011, Bercow served tea to the speaker of North Korea. Former UKIP leader and Fox News contributor Nigel Farage reacted to the report by branding Bercow a “total hypocrite.”
Bercow prefers North Korea to President Trump. Total hypocrite. https://t.co/Zq5scSRkm4 — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 7, 2017
10 Downing Street did not return a request for comment from Fox News. The speaker’s office declined to comment on the accusations of hypocrisy.
Bercow’s move is likely to further sour his already hostile relationship with Tory MPs. In 2010, Conservative MP Simon Burns called the 5-foot, 6-inch speaker a ""stupid, sanctimonious dwarf.” Another MP told The Daily Telegraph in 2015 that Bercow is “gratuitously unpleasant, nasty, bitchy and childish.”
The Telegraph itself lambasted Bercow in an editorial Monday: ""No doubt this latest act of self-indulgent attention-seeking is another part of his legacy-building. In fact, he will go down in history as a Speaker whose arrogance and self-regard besmirched his great office.""
Bercow’s reputation for seeking the limelight also extends to his wife, Sally Bercow, who has appeared on TV show “Celebrity Big Brother,” and was roundly criticized by Tories in 2012 when she posed for a London newspaper in nothing but a bedsheet, and called her husband’s role an “aphrodisiac.”
“I never realised then how sexy I would find living under Big Ben with the bells chiming,” she told the London Evening Standard.
In 2015 Bercow was subject to a coup attempt by then-Leader of the House William Hague – a coup reportedly backed by then-Prime Minister David Cameron, with whom Bercow had publicly clashed on a number of occasions.
While Bercow survived the vote, with the help of Labour MPs, his snub of Trump could embolden his critics.
Tory MP Nadine Dorries told the BBC Monday: ""When he loses support for what was a very partisan moment I think his position will become more and more in jeopardy.”",neutral
194,"It’s rather unusual for a president to proclaim to the world that he is making his own decisions.
Can anyone really doubt that President Trump, in these early weeks, is what George Bush used to call The Decider?
But the 45th president, reacting to a wave of negative media accounts about stumbles and staff screw-ups, tweeted yesterday morning:
“I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!” Trump also accused the “failing @nytimes” of writing “total fiction.”
This came after “Morning Joe” chatter about the sizable role of chief strategist Steve Bannon and a New York Times piece reporting on “Mr. Trump’s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council.” From now on, the paper said, “Mr. Trump would be looped in on the drafting of executive orders much earlier in the process.”
The tweet also follows a Time cover on Bannon as the “Great Manipulator” (he wasn’t quoted), along with an “SNL” skit portraying Bannon’s Darth Vader as the real POTUS.
The “fake news” charge is now thrown around so often that its meaning has been diminished. The Times story, for instance, quotes Sean Spicer, Chris Christie and Ari Fleischer, among others. But Spicer yesterday called the piece ""the epitome of fake news,"" saying it was ""so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology."" He said the portrait of Trump wandering the White House at night in his bathrobe is untrue because the president doesn't wear a bathrobe.
Another Trump tweet yesterday took issue with the polls: “Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.”
I think the polls actually help him on this point. A Gallup poll showed a 49 percent plurality supporting his temporary travel ban, a far different picture than the media coverage portraying the policy as a gargantuan mistake. (The rollout, however, has been undeniably rocky and is now tied up in court.)
Polls can be wrong, misleading or improperly weighted. But they are not fake. Major news organizations, including Fox, hire professional pollsters to do these surveys, and when a spate of polls show Trump’s popularity in the same range, it gives you a rough indication of public sentiment. I’ve argued that Trump’s numbers are depressed because he is fighting so many battles in what remains a divided country.
The president is also taking heat for calling the federal judge in Seattle who temporarily blocked his travel ban a “so-called judge.” That seems unduly dismissive. But he’s certainly entitled to say that the ruling is “ridiculous” and “will be overturned.”
Ultimately, the Trump administration will be judged on results, not tweets. But with so much focus on the early skirmishes involving the White House, he is pushing back increasingly hard against the press.",negative

“I don’t know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy – yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!” Trump tweeted.

199,"The Justice Department argued Tuesday that a federal appeals court should overturn a district court judge's order halting President Trump's executive action suspending travel to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim nations.
The hearing before the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judges was the greatest legal challenge yet to the travel ban, which has upended travel to the U.S. for more than a week and tested the new administration's use of executive power.
Several states have fought the ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen — and insisted that it is unconstitutional.
Justice Department attorney August Flentje asked the court to restore Trump's order, contending that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States, as well as suspend classes of aliens when their entry to the country is otherwise detrimental to national security.
""That's what the president did here,"" Flentje argued.
The government described the executive order as a ""90-day pause"" needed to ensure adequate standards were in place for visa screening, which Flentje called ""plainly constitutional.""
Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, asked whether the government has any evidence connecting the seven nations to terrorism.
Flentje cited a number of Somalis in the U.S. who, he said, had been connected to the al-Shabab terrorist group terror group after judges asked for evidence. Flentje added that the case was moving fast and the government had not yet included additional evidence to support the ban.
Flentje also noted that the executive order was based in part on a determination made by the Obama administration and Congress over the past two years that labeled the countries in question as either having a significant presence by a foreign terrorist organization or being a state sponsor of terrorism.
The final minutes of the hearing were largely devoted to whether the travel ban was intended to discriminate against Muslims.
Judge Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush nominee, asked an attorney representing Washington state and Minnesota, which are challenging the ban, what evidence he had that it was motivated by religion.
""I have trouble understanding why we're supposed to infer religious animus when in fact the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected.""
He said only 15 percent of the world's Muslims were affected, according to his calculations, and said the ""concern for terrorism from those connected to radical Islamic sects is hard to deny.""
Noah Purcell, Washington state's solicitor general, cited public statements by Trump calling for a ban on the entry of Muslims to the U.S. He said the states did not have to show every Muslim is harmed, only that the ban was motivated by religious discrimination.
Under questioning from Clifton, Flentje did not dispute that Trump made the statements.
Washington state, Minnesota and other states challenging the ban want the appellate court to allow a temporary restraining order blocking the travel ban — which also temporarily suspended the country's refugee program — to stand as their lawsuit moves through the legal system.
Purcell said that restraining order has not harmed the U.S. government.
Instead, he told the panel, the order had harmed Washington state residents by splitting up families, holding up students trying to travel for their studies and preventing people from visiting family abroad.
Clifton said he suspected that only a ""small fraction"" of the state's residents were affected.
The court adjourned with Friendland promising a ruling would come ""as soon as possible."" Whatever the court eventually decides, either side could ask the Supreme Court to intervene.
It is also possible that the panel could make a ruling on a technical point, such as whether the lower court's order is properly classified as a temporary restraining order, rather than on the larger merits of the case.

Echoing the Justice Department brief, Conway argued that Friday's decision by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart was ""overly broad.""
""It’s a nationwide injunction,"" Conway said. ""He referenced religion where, in fact, that has nothing to do with the executive order.""
""The fact is,"" she added. ""we don’t even know if these states that sued have standing. Individuals have standing and individuals usually need to show harm and damages.""
Conway also argued that Robart was ""wrong from the bench"" when he stated that no one from the seven countries named in Trump's executive order — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen — had been arrested on terror charges in the United States since 2001. An Associated Press report described Robart's statement as ""a step too far.""

Trump has repeatedly vowed to construct a massive wall along the southern border, a vow he repeated to O'Reilly. He also said that he would revisit the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, a pact he repeatedly criticized on the campaign trail.
""I’m going to put another F in the name NAFTA,"" Trump said. ""Because right now it’s free trade and I’m going to have it ‘fair trade’ also, because it’s not fair. We’re losing $60 billion a year in trade deficits with Mexico. Can’t do that.""
The president also criticized a push by California lawmakers to make the Golden State a so-called ""sanctuary state"" that would prohibit local law enforcement from cooperating with immigration authorities.

""I think it's ridiculous,"" Trump said. ""I will tell you that sanctuary cities are – they’ve got a lot of problems and there’s tremendous crime. A lot of people agree with me, this was a campaign issue.
""We will certainly not stand for sanctuary even cities, let alone states.""

202,"President Trump continued his assault on mainstream polling on Monday morning, tweeting that any poll showing his controversial immigration ban is unpopular is “fake news” and asserting his internal statistics are superior.
The tweets come as Trump tries to galvanize support for his orders placing restrictions on travelers from seven countries and pausing Syrian refugee resettlement. The Justice Department is currently fighting against a federal judge’s ruling halting those executive actions.
“Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting,” Trump tweeted.
He added: “I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!”
Trump’s early-morning slam of network polling came just days after a CNN/ORC poll found 6-in-10 people opposed Trump’s planned wall on the Mexican border and 53 percent of respondents said they opposed Trump’s immigration executive order.

205,"The Trump administration is exploring ways to break Russia’s military and diplomatic alliance with Iran in a bid to both end the Syrian conflict and bolster the fight against Islamic State, said senior administration, European and Arab officials involved in the policy discussions.
The emerging strategy seeks to reconcile President Donald Trump’s seemingly contradictory vows to improve relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and to aggressively challenge the military presence of Iran—one of Moscow’s most critical allies—in the Middle East, these officials say.
A senior administration official said the White House doesn’t have any illusions about Russia or see Mr. Putin as a “choir boy,” despite further conciliatory statements from Mr. Trump about the Russian leader over the weekend. But the official said that the administration doesn’t view Russia as the same existential threat that the Soviet Union posed to the U.S. during the Cold War and that Mr. Trump was committed to constraining Iran.
TRUMP SAYS PENCE TO LEAD VOTER REGISTRATION FRAUD PROBE, LEAVES DOOR OPEN ON IRAN DEAL FUTURE
Such a strategy doesn’t entirely explain the mixed signals Mr. Trump and his circle have sent regarding Moscow, which have unnerved U.S. allies and caught Republican leaders in Congress off guard.
Mr. Trump himself spoke again about wanting to mend relations with Mr. Putin in an interview that aired before Sunday’s Super Bowl, saying “it’s better to get along with Russia than not.” After Fox News host Bill O’Reilly said Mr. Putin was a “killer,” the president responded: “What, you think our country’s so innocent?”
But those involved in the latest policy discussions argue there is a specific focus on trying to drive a wedge between Russia and Iran.
The Kremlin has said it aims to mend ties with the U.S. under the Trump administration but in recent months has also signaled its intent to continue to build on its cooperation with Iran.
Moscow and Tehran have formed a tight military alliance in Syria in recent years. The Kremlin is a major supplier of weapons systems and nuclear equipment to Iran.

206,"Lawyers for Minnesota and Washington state told a federal appellate court Monday that it would “unleash chaos” if it lifted an order temporarily halting President Trump’s ban on refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslims countries from entering the U.S.
The states said in briefs filed with the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Trump’s travel ban harmed residents, businesses and universities and stated that the ban was unconstitutional.
The legal maneuvers by the two states were accompanied by briefs filed by the technology industry arguing that the travel ban would harm their companies by making it more difficult to recruit employees.
Tech giants Apple and Google, along with Uber, filed their arguments with the court late Sunday.
A federal judge in Seattle imposed a temporary restraining order on Trump’s ban, in response to a case filed last week by Washington and Minnesota challenging Trump’s constitutional authority to unilaterally impose such a sweeping ban.
On Saturday night, a federal appeals court denied a Trump administration request to lift the restraining order and allow the immigration ban to continue.
That ruling prompted an ongoing Twitter rant by Trump, who dismissed U.S. District Court Judge James Robart as a ""so-called judge"" and his decision ""ridiculous.""
Trump renewed his Twitter attacks against Robart on Sunday. ""Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!"" He followed with another tweet saying he had instructed the Homeland Security Department to check people coming into the country but that ""the courts are making the job very difficult!""
Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that the federal judge who halted Trump’s temporary immigration ban “made the wrong decision” and vowed to use “all legal means at our disposal” to protect Americans.
“From the outset of his campaign and administration, the president of the United States has made it clear to put the safety of the American people first,” Pence said. “We are going to win this argument.”
Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27 that temporarily halted immigration from seven mostly Muslim nations and the United States’ Syrian refugee program. The order follows his steadfast argument that radical Islamic terrorism poses a major threat to Americans’ safety.
The order immediately caused confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the U.S., prompted nationwide airport protests and led to multiple court challenges.
The federal government has until later today to respond to the state's briefs.

""What do you think? Our country's so innocent?"" Trump said during the taped interview broadcast during Sunday's Super Bowl pregame show.
Trump said in the interview that he respected Putin, ""but that doesn't mean I'm going to get along with him. He's a leader of his country. I say it's better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world — that's a good thing,"" Trump said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. ""Will I get along with him? I have no idea.""
O'Reilly then said about Putin: ""But he's a killer, though. Putin's a killer.""
Trump responded: ""There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., immediately looked to distance himself from Trump’s comments in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“Putin's a former KGB agent. He's a thug. He was not elected in a way that most people would consider a credible election,"" he said. “The Russians annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine and messed around in our elections.

Sasse added that he didn’t know what Trump was trying to do with “comments like these.”
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also chimed in with their criticisms about Trump’s statements on Putin and Russia.

208,"President Trump was reportedly not fully briefed on the executive order he signed that allowed his chief strategist Steve Bannon a seat at the meetings of the country’s top national security efforts.
The New York Times reported Sunday that Bannon has been telling allies that he and the White House policy director, Stephen Miller, have a window to push through their vision of Trump’s economic policies.
Trump was frustrated over the executive order and reportedly demanded to be looped in on the executive orders earlier in the drafting process. According to the Times, Trump demanded that his chief of staff Reince Priebus to come up with a fundamental approach to executive orders.
Priebus told Trump and Bannon that the administration needs to revamp its policy and communications after the recent leaks about the orders coming out. Priebus created a 10-point checklist for the release of any new initiatives that needs a signoff from the White House communications department, The Times reported.
Trump restructured the White House National Security Council at the end of January, adding Bannon to the principals committee, which includes the secretaries of state and defense. At the same time, Trump said his director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would attend ""where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.""
Bannon served in the Navy before attending Harvard Business School, working at Goldman Sachs, starting his own media-focused boutique investment banking firm and later heading the ultraconservative outlet Breitbart News, which has been accused of featuring racist, sexist and anti-Semitic content.
""He is a former naval officer. He's got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer told ABC's ""This Week"" last month.

209,"The Justice Department Monday asked a federal appeals court to restore President Trump's ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations, the latest salvo in a legal fight headed for a possible showdown at the Supreme Court.
The filing with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals came three days after a federal judge in Washington state halted Trump's order and granted a nationwide stay. The Justice Department said U.S. District Judge James Robart's order was ""vastly overbroad"" and said Trump's executive order was ""a lawful exercise of the President's authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees.""
The appeals court refused to immediately reinstate the ban, and lawyers for Washington and Minnesota -- two states challenging it -- argued anew on Monday that any resumption would ""unleash chaos again,"" separating families and stranding university students.
Oral arguments were set for Tuesday afternoon. Whatever the appeals court decides, either side could ask the Supreme Court to intervene.
It could prove difficult, though, to find the necessary five votes at the high court to undo a lower court order; the Supreme Court has been at less than full strength since Justice Antonin Scalia's death a year ago. The last immigration case that reached the justices ended in a 4-4 tie.
The president's executive order has faced legal uncertainty ever since Friday's ruling by Robart, which challenged both Trump's authority and his ability to fulfill a campaign promise.
The State Department quickly said people from the seven countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — could travel to the U.S. if they had valid visas. The Homeland Security Department said it was no longer directing airlines to prevent affected visa holders from boarding U.S.-bound planes.
On Monday in Colorado, a graduate student who had traveled to Libya with her 1-year-old son to visit her sick mother and attend her father's funeral was back in Fort Collins after having been stopped in Jordan on her return trip. She was welcomed with flowers and balloons by her husband and other children.
Two Yemeni brothers whose family has sued over the travel ban, and who'd been turned away in the chaotic opening days of the order, arrived at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, where they were greeted by their father.
""America is for everybody,"" Aqel Aziz said after greeting his sons.
Syrian immigrant Mathyo Asali said he thought his life was ""ruined"" when he landed at Philadelphia International Airport on Jan. 28 only to be denied entry to the United States. Asali, who returned to Damascus, said he figured he'd be inducted into the Syrian military. He was back on U.S. soil Monday.
""It's really nice to know that there's a lot of people supporting us,"" Asali told Gov. Tom Wolf, who greeted the family at a relative's house in Allentown.
The legal fight involves two divergent views of the role of the executive branch and the court system.
The government has asserted that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States, while Robart has said a judge's job is to ensure that an action taken by the government ""comports with our country's laws.""
His Friday ruling triggered a Twitter rant by Trump, who dismissed Robart as a ""so-called judge."" On Sunday, Trump tweeted, ""Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!""
States challenging the ban have been joined by technology companies, who have said it makes it more difficult to recruit employees. National security officials under President Barack Obama have also come out against it. A declaration filed by John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, former secretaries of state, and others said the ban would disrupt lives and cripple U.S. counterterrorism partnerships without making the nation safer.
""It will aid ISIL's propaganda effort and serve its recruitment message by feeding into the narrative that the United States is at war with Islam,"" they wrote.
How and when a case might get to the Supreme Court is unclear. The travel ban itself is to expire in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before a higher court takes up the issue. Or the administration could change it in any number of ways that would keep the issue alive.
The bench also could be full, with a new ninth justice on board, by the time the court is ready to hear arguments. If Judge Neil Gorsuch is confirmed this spring as Senate Republicans hope, chances of a tie vote would disappear.

210,"A group that promotes urban renewal says President Trump should consider its list of America’s worst highways in his $1 trillion infrastructure plan – and erase them from the map altogether.
The group, the Congress for New Urbanism, wants the president to include its recent study, “Freeways Without Futures” in the infrastructure initiative he plans to roll out soon. The study suggests that 10 of the worst highways and stretches of interstate in the U.S. need to be eliminated to make way for urban growth.
Trump has made it his priority to improve the country’s decaying infrastructure. He vowed to deliver an ambitious rebuilding package to Congress within his first 100 days in office.
“These highways should absolutely be on the list of federal infrastructure priorities,” said Lynn Richards, president and CEO of CNU. “Replacing them with boulevards would save money, support small business, and open up land for new development. You see it being done in the inner city in places like Akron, Rochester, and Chattanooga -- with bipartisan support…It fits perfectly with the new administration's priorities.”
Out of the group’s list of 10 highways, six are interstate highways – which mean they would be entitled to federal funding. Trump has promised to spend $1 trillion repairing the country’s national infrastructure.
While the highways on the list were built with good intentions, they led to urban decay in the communities they were built, Richards said. The list includes highways all across the country, from Buffalo, New York to San Francisco.
“The neighborhoods were absolutely devastated. Often hundreds or thousands of people were displaced,” she told Fox News. “Residents were cut off from services; businesses were cut off from customers. Additionally, these highways brought in severe pollution and dangerous speeding traffic. In a lot of cases, these cities' downtowns and neighborhoods fell apart economically.”
The nonprofit strongly believes that demolishing the highways will help the communities they devastated make a comeback.
But some experts do not think the solution will be all that simple.
“These roads were built mostly in the '60s and '70s. They divided neighborhoods and destroyed them,” said John Landis, a professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania. “But it was a long time ago and I don’t think you can bring those neighborhoods back. It would be an entirely new development. Just getting rid of these roads wouldn’t bring them back.”
Still, Landis does believe that razing these highways is a good idea. But he doubts those projects would be funded under Trump’s new infrastructure plan.
“No one knows what will be included in this new [infrastructure] plan. Let’s suppose it’s a trillion dollars…well it’s estimated that we have a total of $3 trillion needed in repairs,” he said. “These roads are secondary priorities. That money will go to primary projects.”
But Richards believes that tearing down the highways will be cost effective in the long run.
“Not every urban freeway needs to be dismantled. But when they near the end of their design life, we have to weigh that option against the costs of replacement,” she said. “…We're talking about a lot of additional land opening up where these freeways used to be, and that land can be used to build businesses, apartments, affordable housing, parks – whatever the community needs.”

The reason: Donald Trump.
The Museum of Modern Art has pulled down some works by the likes of Picasso and Matisse to display paintings from predominantly Muslim nations.
The reason: Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban.
Nordstrom’s is pulling the Ivanka Trump clothing line.
The reason: Her father. (The company says the line isn’t selling well, but how coincidental that the announcement comes two weeks into the administration.) Neiman Marcus also just dropped her jewelry from its website.
These are the latest signs of a culture war that seems to have enveloped the 45th president, and probably won’t end any time soon. It kicked into high gear with the cast of “Hamilton” and hasn’t let up.
The axing of the most exclusive after-party associated with the White House Correspondents Dinner is highly symbolic.
Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair’s editor, gave the New York Times a one-word explanation of the cancellation: “Trump.” Instead, he said, he’s going fishing.
No one outside the Beltway may give a flying fig. The glossy magazines are entitled to criticize Trump all they want, and there’s no law required them to spend big bucks on the Washington parties. But consider this: Vanity Fair began co-sponsoring the party in 2009, the first year of Barack Obama’s presidency.
It’s not clear whether the other sponsor, Bloomberg, will carry on alone. No comedian has been hired for the dinner itself. And Samantha Bee will headline a counter-event in Washington that night, drawing some attention away from the black-tie extravaganza.
At the same time, some critics, such as a top U.S. News editor, are saying that journalists should skip the April event. While there has been carping for years that the Washington Hilton dinner has become a celebrity-studded affair and the press shouldn’t be so cozy with the president and his people, the boycott calls have become more urgent this year since Trump would be the guest of honor. (Trump, who was famously taunted by Obama at the 2011 dinner, is expected to attend but has not officially accepted. The press-bashing part of his monologue will probably come easy.)
We’re in an era now where no Hollywood awards ceremony is complete without movie stars and singers denouncing Trump.
That draws applause from their peers, even if many viewers would rather the events not be polluted by politics.
The same is true in business. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigned from Trump’s economic advisory council after a #DeleteUber Twitterstorm that began with the company’s conduct during the immigration protests. And Starbucks is facing online calls for a boycott after it announced plans to hire 10,000 refugees from around the world.
Even the Super Bowl was marked by Trumpian overtones beyond the pre-game interview he gave Bill O’Reilly. Reporters constantly asked Tom Brady about his friendship with Trump, as if the Patriots quarterback had to justify supporting his pal. (Trump happily entered the fray by calling NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who suspended Brady for four games in the “Deflategate” uproar, “a weak guy” and a “dope.”)
All this reeks of a refusal to accept the election results and a certain disrespect to the office of the presidency. The country is divided over Trump, but not the liberal crowd that comprises the audience for the publishers, entertainers and fashionistas.
Too bad. They would have enjoyed the parties and the dinner if Hillary Clinton had won. Now they’re just another political football.",negative
212,"A Cuban artist who courted controversy with a magazine cover depicting President Donald Trump as a terrorist holding the Statue of Liberty’s severed head has been considerably softer on his country’s sibling dictators, a fellow artist who has done time in Havana’s jails for his own political satire told Fox News.
Danilo Maldonado said he wonders why Edel Rodriguez, who has lived in the United States since he fled Cuba with his family in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, has not produced works about Fidel and Raul Castro that are as explosive and damning as the one that he did of Trump for the German magazine Der Spiegel.
But Maldonado, who is famous internationally for works of art that take aim at the Communist regime and human rights violations, says that as someone who constantly pushes boundaries through his own creations, he defends Rodriguez’s right to artistic expression.
“Artistic freedom must always be protected,” said Maldonado, “An artist must be able to express his feelings, his perspective. Everyone, artists and people who are not artists, should have freedom of expression.”
Maldonado has paid the price for his own artistic expression. Cuban authorities jailed him for nearly two months for spray painting “He’s gone” the day after Fidel Castro died in late November. His friends and relatives said that the regime viewed the message as celebratory and disrespectful.
Maldonado was released on Jan. 21 and was never charged. He said he was moved to six different jails and beat up several times.
He plans to testify about human rights violations before the U.S. Senate foreign affairs committee on Feb. 16, and at the Geneva human rights convention on Feb. 21.

At the moment, Maldonado is visiting his girlfriend in Miami as he prepares for an exhibit of his work in San Francisco. Maldonado, whose nickname is “El Sexto,” plans to return to Cuba, despite the harassment he says he faces and the various times he has been jailed for art deemed counter-revolutionary.
“I do not denounce people who have decided to leave,” Maldonado said, “but I feel I must stay, and the more people who stay instead of flee the more pressure on the dictatorship. It’s the thugs who have an entire population held hostage who should leave Cuba, not the people they are oppressing.”
That is why, Maldonado said, he is not against the end of the wet-foot-dry-foot policy that allowed Cubans reaching U.S. shores to remain here. Former President Barack Obama ended the policy in his last week in office.

213,"Iran's ongoing tests of ballistic missiles has shown that Iran is in no mood to comply with the United Nations, and justifies a decision by President Trump to ""tear up"" the Iran nuclear deal, according to former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton.
Bolton, who Trump was considering for secretary of state during the transition, said new sanctions and tougher talk from Trump won't be enough to curb Iran's actions.
""Iran's continued missile testing on Saturday has given President Trump one more reason to tear up his predecessor's deal with the regime in Tehran,"" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal.
Bolton called the Iran deal ""diplomatic malpractice,"" and noted that the Iran nuclear agreement is an annex to a UN resolution that includes another annex that simply says Iran is ""called upon"" not to engage in any activity related to ballistic missiles that are ""designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.""

214,"President Trump, in an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, announced he’ll name Vice President Pence to lead a commission investigating voter registration fraud – while also laying out timelines for top domestic priorities like tax cuts and health care, and leaving the door open to scrapping the Iran nuclear deal.
The president, in the interview aired Sunday on Fox Sports ahead of Super Bowl LI, defended his past complaints about “illegals” potentially voting.
“You take a look at the registration, you have illegals, you have dead people … it’s really a bad situation,” he said.
Though Trump did not sign a previously expected executive order initiating a voter fraud probe, he said in the interview he’s going to assign Pence to the job, seemingly making good on a vow to hold a “major” investigation.
“I’m going to set up a commission, to be headed by Vice President Mike Pence, and we’re going to look at it very, very carefully,” he said.
The president – who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million but won the Electoral College and with it the White House – has insisted since the election that millions of illegal immigrants and others improperly cast ballots.
Amid criticism of those claims and questions about what proof he has, however, Trump appeared to pull back Sunday on the allegations of rampant voter fraud, focusing more on voter registration problems as evidence.
Watch more of the Trump interview on “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET on Fox News Channel.
On the heels of his administration imposing new sanctions on Iran-tied businesses and individuals in response to recent missile tests, Trump also said Iran has “total disregard” for America and revived his criticism of the 2015 nuclear deal struck by his predecessor. The agreement with other world powers lifted billions in economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country curtailing its nuclear weapons program.
Trump called it “the worst deal I’ve ever seen negotiated.”
He said he wasn’t outright opposed to the deal, but claimed that it hasn’t been enforced.
“They’re sending money all over the place and weapons, and you can’t do that,” he said.
Asked whether he’d scrap it, Trump said, “We’ll see what happens.”
He continued, “That deal, I would have lived with it if they said, OK we’re all together now. But it was just the opposite, it’s like they’re emboldened.”
As for the new sanctions, Trump said, “just starting.”
Trump would not confirm reports that the U.S. has repositioned a key warship, after accusing former President Obama of revealing too much.
“I won’t give away military secrets,” he said.
As for domestic policy matters, Trump told O’Reilly he intends to have a replacement ready for ObamaCare by the end of the year or in early 2018.
He acknowledged that replacing the troubled health care law that now covers as many as 20 million Americans is “very complicated.”
Trump also said Americans probably can expect a tax cut sometime in 2017.
As for his recent calls to foreign leaders, Trump said he has ""respect"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin, but that respect does not mean they'll get along.
""I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not,” he said. “And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world -- that’s a good thing. … Will I get along with him? I have no idea.""
Pressed about Putin's history of violence, Trump said: ""There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country’s so innocent?”",negative

216,"President Donald Trump predicted that the New England Patriots would defeat the Atlanta Falcons in Sunday's Super Bowl, a result that would bring a fifth NFL championship for head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady.
In an exclusive interview on the Fox network's Super Bowl pregame show, Trump told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly that he thought the Patriots would win ""by eight points.""
TOM BRADY EVASIVE ABOUT RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
""I like [Patriots owner] Bob Kraft, I like Coach Belichick, and Tom Brady’s my friend,"" said Trump, who later added, ""Tom's a winner.""
Trump did not mention the Falcons or quarterback Matt Ryan by name, but said they were a ""fantastic team.""
""You know, there’s less pressure on the Patriots because they’ve been there,"" the president said. ""You know, once you’ve won, and you’ve done it, and they’ve done it, once you’ve done it there’s a lot less pressure. So we’ll see what happens but you know you have to stick up for your friends.""
The three most visible figures on the Patriots all have ties to Trump. Kraft told The New York Times last month that he and Trump have known each other for two decades, while Belichick wrote Trump a letter which the GOP candidate read to a crowd in New Hampshire late in the campaign.
Brady has been more circumspect in discussing his relationship with Trump ever since a ""Make America Great"" again hat was found in his locker during the 2015 season.
""Um, I have called him, yes, in the past,"" Brady told a Boston radio station after advancing to his seventh Super Bowl with New England. ""“Sometimes he calls me. Sometimes I call him. But, again, that's been someone that I've known. I always try to keep it in context because for 16 years you know someone before maybe he was in the position that he was in. He's been very supportive of me for a long time. It's just a friendship. I have a lot of friends. I call a lot of people.""
""Why does everybody make such a big deal? I don’t understand it,"" Brady asked later in the conversation.",positive
217,"President Trump on Saturday denounced the leaks of transcripts of his telephone conversations with leaders of Australia and Mexico as “disgraceful” and said his administration was searching “very, very hard” for the leakers.
Trump, speaking to Fox News, accused “Obama people” of giving news organizations embarrassing details of his recent tense phone conversations with his Australian and Mexican counterparts, and said that the holdovers from the Obama administration still serving on his White House and National Security Council staff were being replaced.
“It’s a disgrace that they leaked because it’s very much against our country,” Trump said, without stating why he believed that career civil servants who work in Democratic and Republican administrations were the source of the leaks. “It’s a very dangerous thing for this country,” he said.
Trump said that media reports of what appeared to be angry exchanges between him and the two foreign leaders had been mischaracterized, and insisted that he had “positive” relations with both countries and their leaders.
Meanwhile, hours before a federal judge in San Francisco turned down the Trump administration’s request to reinstate travel restrictions on refugees and foreign travelers, President Trump defended his administration’s travel ban, saying the temporary halt was needed while the administration reviewed vetting procedures to prevent “people with bad intentions” from entering the country.
“I just want a safe country, and you can’t have a safe country with open and weak borders…you can’t,” he said.
Trump said that the FBI had informed him that the bureau had “1,000 investigations” ongoing into potential terrorist threats and lacked sufficient manpower to pursue them all.
Finally, he disputed press reports which characterized the sanctions he imposed last week on Iran as weak and ineffective. He said that punishing Tehran for violating United Nations Security Council restrictions on ballistic missile testing was “the right thing to do,” and argued that the sanctions were already beginning to constrain Iranian aggression. Iran, he said, was trying to undermine and destabilize U.S. allies by exporting sensitive technology to countries “around the world” and that such aggressive conduct had to be countered. The sanctions were already working, he asserted. “Have you noticed they’ve been very quiet in the last two days?”
Trump made these and other comments in a conversation with three journalists whom he had invited to join him after the 60th annual International Red Cross ball, a fundraiser for the charity that was held this year at his club, Mar-a-Lago.
In his first trip back to his home in Palm Beach since becoming president, Trump answered several questions on wide-ranging topics from this reporter, Christopher Ruddy, founder and chief of Newsmax Media, and Melanie Dickinson, president and publisher of the South Florida Business Journal, an online and print business publication. Trump and his wife Melania lingered on after the ball to mix with admirers and some of the estimated 800 Red Cross supporters attending the black-tie event at Mar-a-lago, which has become known as “The Winter White House.”
While wealthy supporters of the charity rubbed shoulders with one another and clustered around the table occupied by Trump and his wife, eager to congratulate him and take photos with First Couple, some 4,000 people turned out for an anti-Trump march in West Palm Beach. Hundreds of protesters made their way from Trump Tower in West Palm Beach to a staging area near Palm Beach on Bingham Island, and then to the entrance of the exclusive club, where they shouted anti-Trump slogans and yelled chants against the new administration’s policies. Many of the protesters, most of whom were peaceful, carried placards criticizing Trump, his immigration and other policies, and several of his wealthy Cabinet nominees. The protest was among the largest, if not the largest, in recent Palm Beach county history.
Inside the huge ornate ballroom, Trump seemed particularly insistent on disputing the notion that his travel restrictions now being challenged by several courts were unpopular. “They’re very popular,” he insisted. But, he added, he would have imposed them whether or not Americans approved of them. “I’m not doing it for popularity. I’m doing it because our country is like a sieve for people coming in,” he said.
He said that he had learned in his meetings with FBI officials that the bureau was having a difficult time staffing the more than 1,000 investigations it was conducting into potential threats to the country. “There’s no manpower to do them.”
Calls to FBI headquarters regarding the number of ongoing terror investigations were not returned on this Super Bowl Sunday. But last summer, James Comey, the FBI director, testified that the bureau had about 1,000 open terror-related investigations in 2016 and at least one in all of the 50 states. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who follows counter-terrorism efforts closely, confirmed that senior FBI officials have spoken of nearly 1,000 ongoing investigations. John Pistole, the former FBI deputy director, told Fox News last summer that the FBI lacked the resources and legal authority to maintain investigations “on everybody they talk to,” he said. The FBI had perpetrators of the terror attacks carried out in Orlando, San Bernardino, and Boston under surveillance for a time, but closed out their inquiries before the attacks.
Trump said Saturday night that many Americans did not realize the danger posed by America’s “open” borders and insufficient vetting. “You don’t realize it,” he said.
However, groups helping asylum seekers, refugees, and other civil and human rights groups point out that no Americans have been killed in domestic terror attacks by asylum seekers and refugees from the seven Middle Eastern countries with majority Muslim populations who would be barred from entering the U.S. for 120 days while the administration reviews its immigration and vetting policies.
Under Trump’s executive order, refugees from Syria would be permanently barred, exclusions whose legality several civil rights and civil liberties experts and groups have challenged. They also argue that political refugees are already among the most heavily vetted of all immigrants.
“I’m doing this because our country is like a sieve for people coming in,” Trump said.
One former CIA official said that while the administration’s implementation of its executive order was “clumsy, the concerns behind it are real.” But the constitutionality of the executive order seems headed for a Supreme Court challenge.
The FBI also did not return calls for comment Sunday on whether it was conducting an investigation into the leaking of transcripts of the president's telephone calls with foreign leaders. While White House press spokesman Sean Spicer recently said that the president had asked his team to “to look into this because those are very serious implications,"" Trump had not previously discussed his own view of the embarrassing leaks. His comments Saturday underscored his concern about what has become widespread early on in his administration — the unauthorized distribution of material highlighting numerous exaggerations and false statements by him and senior members of his White House and other incidents that seem to reflect incompetence or inexperience.
Trump seemed particularly anxious to reinforce his spokesman’s descriptions of his conversations with the leaders of Australia and Mexico as “candid,"" but respectful. Spicer noted that both leaders have disputed some of the details as reported.
Based on the transcripts, the Washington Post and several media outlets, for instance, reported that Trump hung up on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after an angry discussion of a refugee swap negotiated by former President Obama. In a recent interview, Turnbull called his discussion with Trump “frank” but said that Trump had agreed to abide by the refugee swap negotiated by former President Barack Obama. In one interview, he said it had been a ""good week"" for Australia.
In an earlier call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump apparently threatened to send the U.S. military to Mexico to stop drug cartels -- according to a transcript published by a Mexican news organization and the Associated Press. The White House later said the comments were intended to be “lighthearted.”",negative
218,"President Trump is sticking with his argument that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the 2016 presidential election, amid calls for him to provide proof and questions about whether he’ll indeed have an official probe into the issue.
“Many people have come out and said I am right,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly to be aired Sunday before the NFL Super Bowl.
Watch the O'Reilly Super Bowl LI interview with Trump at 4 pm ET Sunday on Fox Sports. Tune in for more of the interview on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday and Tuesday at 8 pm ET on Fox News Channel.
Trump didn’t directly answer a question about whether he, in fact, has evidence -- but suggested that he has seen voter-registration records that suggest widespread voter fraud.
“We can be babies, but you take a look at the registration,” Trump said. “You have illegals, you have dead people, you have this. It’s really a bad situation.”
Trump became president by winning the Electoral College vote but did not win the popular vote. And losing that vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by an estimated 3 million ballots has been a continuing source of contention with him.
Last month, Trump suggested he would ask for a “major investigation” through the Justice Department. And he purportedly was considering signing an executive order to start the process. But the administration has not taken any public action on the issue in roughly the past 10 days.
Also on Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R- Ky., told CNN’s “State of the Union” that he doesn’t want to spend federal money to investigate Trump’s allegation.
Trump also said in the Fox interview that he has ""respect"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin, but that respect does not mean they'll get along.
""I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not,” he said. “And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world -- that’s a good thing. … Will I get along with him? I have no idea.""
Pressed about Putin's history of violence, Trump said: ""There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country’s so innocent?",neutral
219,"The Trump administration on Wednesday indicated it would kill any chance of reviving former President Obama's expansion of federal overtime pay rules, with a court filing suggesting that it may withdraw a White House appeal of a federal court's invalidation of the rule.
""The federal government respectfully requests a 30-day extension of time, to and including March 2, 2017, in which to file its reply brief. The requested extension is necessary to allow incoming leadership personnel adequate time to consider the issues,"" the Justice Department said in filing with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
It is highly unlikely the administration will support the rule. Trump's pick to head the Labor Department, fast-food businessman Andrew Puzder, has been highly critical of the Obama administration's effort.
""As with the Obama administration's other efforts to regulate their way to economic prosperity, it will not deliver as promised. ... Turning highly sought-after entry level management careers into hourly jobs where employees punch a clock and are compensated for time spent rather than time well spent is hardly an improvement on the path from the working class to the middle class,"" Puzder said in May op-ed for Forbes.

220,"The Trump administration has instituted a media blackout for the Environmental Protection Agency, banning press releases and social media posts on official agency accounts, a source told Fox News.
The prohibitions came to light as the agency moved to delay implementation of at least 30 environmental rules finalized in the closing months of President Obama’s term, a potential first step to seeking to kill the regulations.
Staffers in EPA’s public affairs office are instructed to forward all inquiries from reporters to the Office of Administration and Resources Management.
""Not the most inspiring time at EPA right now but we're fighters,” the EPA staffer, who would only speak on condition of anonymity said.
The source, who also has direct knowledge of agency contracts and grants, confirmed that the agency has been asked to temporarily halt all contracts and grants pending review.
“Yes to freeze on new contracts and grants and no new funding on existing ones. There will supposedly be exceptions moving forward but unclear at this point,” the source said.
The Trump administration has also ordered what it called a temporary suspension of all new business activities at the department, including issuing task orders or work assignments to EPA contractors. The orders were expected to have a significant and immediate impact on EPA activities nationwide.
EPA contracts with outside vendors for a wide array of services, from engineering and research science to janitorial supplies.
The Washington Post reported Monday that an email was sent to employees of the Office of Acquisition Management from the incoming EPA administration to temporarily suspend “all contract and grant awards.” The email was reportedly sent within hours of Trump’s inauguration ceremony.
Competitive Enterprise Institute director Myron Ebell, who oversaw the EPA transition for the Trump administration, told ProPublica that the move isn’t unprecedented.
“They’re trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don’t want to have happen, so any regulations going forward, contracts, grants, hires, they want to make sure to look at them first. This may be a little wider than some previous administrations, but it’s very similar to what others have done.”
However, one employee told the publication that he couldn’t recall a similar event happening in 10 years with the agency.
Similar orders barring external communications have been issued in recent days by the Trump administration at other federal agencies, including the departments of Transportation and Agriculture.
Staffers in EPA's public affairs office are instructed to forward all inquiries from reporters to the Office of Administration and Resources Management.
""Incoming media requests will be carefully screened,"" one directive said. ""Only send out critical messages, as messages can be shared broadly and end up in the press.""
A review of EPA websites and social media accounts, which typically include numerous new posts each day, showed no new activity since Friday.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday he had no specific information on the blackout.
""I don't think it's any surprise that when there's an administration turnover, that we're going to review the policies,"" Spicer said.
Doug Ericksen, the communications director for Trump's transition team at EPA, said he expects the communications ban to be lifted by the end of this week.
""We're just trying to get a handle on everything and make sure what goes out reflects the priorities of the new administration,"" Ericksen said.

221,"The following is the executive order signed Wednesday by President Trump on enhancing public safety in the interior of the United States:
ENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), and in order to ensure the public safety of the American people in communities across the United States as well as to ensure that our Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby declare the policy of the executive branch to be, and order, as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. Interior enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States. Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety. This is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.
Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.
Tens of thousands of removable aliens have been released into communities across the country, solely because their home countries refuse to accept their repatriation. Many of these aliens are criminals who have served time in our Federal, State, and local jails. The presence of such individuals in the United States, and the practices of foreign nations that refuse the repatriation of their nationals, are contrary to the national interest.
Although Federal immigration law provides a framework for Federal-State partnerships in enforcing our immigration laws to ensure the removal of aliens who have no right to be in the United States, the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:
(a) Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code;
(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States;
(c) Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;
(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and
(e) Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.
Sec. 3. Definitions. The terms of this order, where applicable, shall have the meaning provided by section 1101 of title 8, United States Code.
Sec. 4. Enforcement of the Immigration Laws in the Interior of the United States. In furtherance of the policy described in section 2 of this order, I hereby direct agencies to employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.
Sec. 5. Enforcement Priorities. In executing faithfully the immigration laws of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress in sections 212(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 235, and 237(a)(2) and (4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227(a)(2) and (4)), as well as removable aliens who:
(a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense;
(b) Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved;
(c) Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense;
(d) Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency;
(e) Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits;
(f) Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or
(g) In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.
Sec. 6. Civil Fines and Penalties. As soon as practicable, and by no later than one year after the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance and promulgate regulations, where required by law, to ensure the assessment and collection of all fines and penalties that the Secretary is authorized under the law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States and from those who facilitate their presence in the United States.
Sec. 7. Additional Enforcement and Removal Officers. The Secretary, through the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, take all appropriate action to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers, who shall complete relevant training and be authorized to perform the law enforcement functions described in section 287 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357).
Sec. 8. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.
(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).
(b) To the extent permitted by law and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.
(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in a manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws for that jurisdiction.
Sec. 9. Sanctuary Jurisdictions. It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure, to the fullest extent of the law, that a State, or a political subdivision of a State, shall comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373.
(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Attorney General and the Secretary, in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions) are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to designate, in his discretion and to the extent consistent with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction. The Attorney General shall take appropriate enforcement action against any entity that violates 8 U.S.C. 1373, or which has in effect a statute, policy, or practice that prevents or hinders the enforcement of Federal law.
(b) To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions, the Secretary shall utilize the Declined Detainer Outcome Report or its equivalent and, on a weekly basis, make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.
(c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is directed to obtain and provide relevant and responsive information on all Federal grant money that currently is received by any sanctuary jurisdiction
Sec. 10. Review of Previous Immigration Actions and Policies. (a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to terminate the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) described in the memorandum issued by the Secretary on November 20, 2014, and to reinstitute the immigration program known as ""Secure Communities"" referenced in that memorandum.
(b) The Secretary shall review agency regulations, policies, and procedures for consistency with this order and, if required, publish for notice and comment proposed regulations rescinding or revising any regulations inconsistent with this order and shall consider whether to withdraw or modify any inconsistent policies and procedures, as appropriate and consistent with the law.
(c) To protect our communities and better facilitate the identification, detention, and removal of criminal aliens within constitutional and statutory parameters, the Secretary shall consolidate and revise any applicable forms to more effectively communicate with recipient law enforcement agencies.
Sec. 11. Department of Justice Prosecutions of Immigration Violators. The Attorney General and the Secretary shall work together to develop and implement a program that ensures that adequate resources are devoted to the prosecution of criminal immigration offenses in the United States, and to develop cooperative strategies to reduce violent crime and the reach of transnational criminal organizations into the United States.
Sec. 12. Recalcitrant Countries. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall cooperate to effectively implement the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), as appropriate.

222,"The following is the executive order President Trump signed Wednesday on border security and immigration enforcement improvements:
BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IMPROVEMENTS
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109‑367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104‑208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that the Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety. Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.
Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs. Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct. Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.
Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nation's southern border. Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws ‑‑ and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders ‑‑ the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation's southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:
(a) secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;
(b) detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding those violations;
(c) expedite determinations of apprehended individuals' claims of eligibility to remain in the United States;
(d) remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed; and
(e) cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.
Sec. 3. Definitions. (a) ""Asylum officer"" has the meaning given the term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).
(b) ""Southern border"" shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.
(c) ""Border States"" shall mean the States of the United States immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico.
(d) Except as otherwise noted, ""the Secretary"" shall refer to the Secretary of Homeland Security.
(e) ""Wall"" shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.

(b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;
(c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and
(d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.
Sec. 5. Detention Facilities. (a) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.
(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable regulations.
(c) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.

The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as ""catch and release,"" whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.
Sec. 7. Return to Territory. The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.
Sec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents. Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.
Sec. 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.
Sec. 10. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.
(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).
(b) To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.
(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.
Sec. 11. Parole, Asylum, and Removal. It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.
(a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens.
(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions.
(c) Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).
(d) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.

223,"The following is the executive order signed Wednesday by President Trump on enhancing public safety in the interior of the United States:
ENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), and in order to ensure the public safety of the American people in communities across the United States as well as to ensure that our Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby declare the policy of the executive branch to be, and order, as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. Interior enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States. Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety. This is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.
Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.
Tens of thousands of removable aliens have been released into communities across the country, solely because their home countries refuse to accept their repatriation. Many of these aliens are criminals who have served time in our Federal, State, and local jails. The presence of such individuals in the United States, and the practices of foreign nations that refuse the repatriation of their nationals, are contrary to the national interest.
Although Federal immigration law provides a framework for Federal-State partnerships in enforcing our immigration laws to ensure the removal of aliens who have no right to be in the United States, the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:
(a) Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code;
(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States;
(c) Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;
(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and
(e) Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.
Sec. 3. Definitions. The terms of this order, where applicable, shall have the meaning provided by section 1101 of title 8, United States Code.
Sec. 4. Enforcement of the Immigration Laws in the Interior of the United States. In furtherance of the policy described in section 2 of this order, I hereby direct agencies to employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.
Sec. 5. Enforcement Priorities. In executing faithfully the immigration laws of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress in sections 212(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 235, and 237(a)(2) and (4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227(a)(2) and (4)), as well as removable aliens who:
(a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense;
(b) Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved;
(c) Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense;
(d) Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency;
(e) Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits;
(f) Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or
(g) In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.
Sec. 6. Civil Fines and Penalties. As soon as practicable, and by no later than one year after the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance and promulgate regulations, where required by law, to ensure the assessment and collection of all fines and penalties that the Secretary is authorized under the law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States and from those who facilitate their presence in the United States.
Sec. 7. Additional Enforcement and Removal Officers. The Secretary, through the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, take all appropriate action to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers, who shall complete relevant training and be authorized to perform the law enforcement functions described in section 287 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357).
Sec. 8. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.
(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).
(b) To the extent permitted by law and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.
(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in a manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws for that jurisdiction.
Sec. 9. Sanctuary Jurisdictions. It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure, to the fullest extent of the law, that a State, or a political subdivision of a State, shall comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373.
(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Attorney General and the Secretary, in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions) are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to designate, in his discretion and to the extent consistent with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction. The Attorney General shall take appropriate enforcement action against any entity that violates 8 U.S.C. 1373, or which has in effect a statute, policy, or practice that prevents or hinders the enforcement of Federal law.
(b) To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions, the Secretary shall utilize the Declined Detainer Outcome Report or its equivalent and, on a weekly basis, make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.
(c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is directed to obtain and provide relevant and responsive information on all Federal grant money that currently is received by any sanctuary jurisdiction
Sec. 10. Review of Previous Immigration Actions and Policies. (a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to terminate the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) described in the memorandum issued by the Secretary on November 20, 2014, and to reinstitute the immigration program known as ""Secure Communities"" referenced in that memorandum.
(b) The Secretary shall review agency regulations, policies, and procedures for consistency with this order and, if required, publish for notice and comment proposed regulations rescinding or revising any regulations inconsistent with this order and shall consider whether to withdraw or modify any inconsistent policies and procedures, as appropriate and consistent with the law.
(c) To protect our communities and better facilitate the identification, detention, and removal of criminal aliens within constitutional and statutory parameters, the Secretary shall consolidate and revise any applicable forms to more effectively communicate with recipient law enforcement agencies.
Sec. 11. Department of Justice Prosecutions of Immigration Violators. The Attorney General and the Secretary shall work together to develop and implement a program that ensures that adequate resources are devoted to the prosecution of criminal immigration offenses in the United States, and to develop cooperative strategies to reduce violent crime and the reach of transnational criminal organizations into the United States.
Sec. 12. Recalcitrant Countries. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall cooperate to effectively implement the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), as appropriate. The Secretary of State shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, ensure that diplomatic efforts and negotiations with foreign states include as a condition precedent the acceptance by those foreign states of their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States.
Sec. 13. Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens. The Secretary shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take all appropriate and lawful action to establish within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens and the family members of such victims. This office shall provide quarterly reports studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.
Sec. 14. Privacy Act. Agencies shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.
Sec. 15. Reporting. Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary and the Attorney General shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order within 90 days of the date of this order and again within 180 days of the date of this order.

The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.
Sec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents. Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.
Sec. 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.

Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.
(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.

225,"In just two days, President Trump has met with corporate honchos, union chiefs and auto executives, courted congressional leaders, frozen federal hiring, killed the Pacific trade deal and moved ahead on two major pipelines.
So are the media filled with headlines about how he’s off to a fast start?
Not exactly.
A front-page New York Times headline says “Meeting with Top Lawmakers, Trump Repeats an Election Lie.”
This is the split-screen reality of the new administration. In television terms, the main image on the screen is the 45th president’s actions, and in a small box on the bottom right is the distraction du jour—Trump declaring war on the media, tweeting something provocative or making an unsubstantiated claim.
And then all of a sudden, that small box is blown up until it fills most of the screen, and what he’s doing officially shrinks to small corner at the bottom.
Some of this reflects the media’s natural preference for sniping over substance. Conflict is captivating, bipartisanship is boring.
Some of it reflects a media aggressiveness toward Trump that was missing in the last administration, and in some quarters an underlying hostility.
And some is Trump’s own doing.
The president turned what had been a sidebar story on the size of his inaugural crowd by taking it on himself and then sending Sean Spicer out for a blistering lecture of the press.
And it’s hard to understand why Trump again repeated his claim to congressional leaders, without evidence, that up to 5 million illegal immigrants voted in the election. State officials have found scant evidence of such illegal voting. I get that Trump is concerned about having lost the popular vote, but he’s still president, and the comment sparked another round of falsehood stories in the media.
Reporters asked Sean Spicer about the issue at least a half-dozen times at yesterday’s briefing. The press secretary simply said “the president does believe that” and “continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence presented to him.” He did not elaborate and quickly moved on each time it was raised.
Now we can debate the impact that Trump’s executive orders on the Keystone and Dakota pipelines will have on jobs, along with his vow to slash regulations by as much as 75 percent. But when the leaders of unions that backed Hillary Clinton are saying nice things about their meeting with a Republican president, that sounds like news.
And when the GOP president has a constructive session with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi along with members of his own party, that strikes a contrast with Barack Obama, who didn’t much like schmoozing with Hill types, including his fellow Democrats.
During the campaign, the media were constantly predicting doom and gloom for Trump as he plunged from one controversy to the next, sometimes hyped, sometimes self-inflicted. The larger story, his connection to working-class voters, was badly missed.
I suspect that the folks who voted for Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are a lot more interested in business regulations and pipeline jobs than in how many people gathered last week on the Mall.",negative
226,"The Trump administration has instituted a media blackout for the Environmental Protection Agency, banning press releases and social media posts on official agency accounts, a source told Fox News.
The prohibitions came to light as the agency moved to delay implementation of at least 30 environmental rules finalized in the closing months of President Obama’s term, a potential first step to seeking to kill the regulations.
Staffers in EPA’s public affairs office are instructed to forward all inquiries from reporters to the Office of Administration and Resources Management.
""Not the most inspiring time at EPA right now but we're fighters,” the EPA staffer, who would only speak on condition of anonymity said.
The source, who also has direct knowledge of agency contracts and grants, confirmed that the agency has been asked to temporarily halt all contracts and grants pending review.
“Yes to freeze on new contracts and grants and no new funding on existing ones. There will supposedly be exceptions moving forward but unclear at this point,” the source said.
The Trump administration has also ordered what it called a temporary suspension of all new business activities at the department, including issuing task orders or work assignments to EPA contractors. The orders were expected to have a significant and immediate impact on EPA activities nationwide.
EPA contracts with outside vendors for a wide array of services, from engineering and research science to janitorial supplies.
The Washington Post reported Monday that an email was sent to employees of the Office of Acquisition Management from the incoming EPA administration to temporarily suspend “all contract and grant awards.” The email was reportedly sent within hours of Trump’s inauguration ceremony.
Competitive Enterprise Institute director Myron Ebell, who oversaw the EPA transition for the Trump administration, told ProPublica that the move isn’t unprecedented.
“They’re trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don’t want to have happen, so any regulations going forward, contracts, grants, hires, they want to make sure to look at them first. This may be a little wider than some previous administrations, but it’s very similar to what others have done.”
However, one employee told the publication that he couldn’t recall a similar event happening in 10 years with the agency.
Similar orders barring external communications have been issued in recent days by the Trump administration at other federal agencies, including the departments of Transportation and Agriculture.
Staffers in EPA's public affairs office are instructed to forward all inquiries from reporters to the Office of Administration and Resources Management.
""Incoming media requests will be carefully screened,"" one directive said. ""Only send out critical messages, as messages can be shared broadly and end up in the press.""
A review of EPA websites and social media accounts, which typically include numerous new posts each day, showed no new activity since Friday.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday he had no specific information on the blackout.
""I don't think it's any surprise that when there's an administration turnover, that we're going to review the policies,"" Spicer said.
Doug Ericksen, the communications director for Trump's transition team at EPA, said he expects the communications ban to be lifted by the end of this week.
""We're just trying to get a handle on everything and make sure what goes out reflects the priorities of the new administration,"" Ericksen said.

227,"A Denver-based Secret Service agent’s assertion that she would rather go to jail than take a bullet for President Trump left veterans of the commander-in-chief’s vaunted security detail stunned.
Gary Byrne, who guarded President Clinton and the Oval Office during a 12-year stint with the Secret Service, told Fox News Special Agent Kerry O’Grady’s revelation on Facebook was astonishing.
“It is unheard of and unbelievable that someone at her level would comment publicly on being unwilling to protect the president,” said Byrne, author of “Crisis of Character,” a book that came out during the presidential campaign that was highly critical of Hillary Clinton. “Everyone has their own personal political opinions, but this job is not personal. You take an oath to the country, not the person. You are protecting the office, and what makes the country great.”
Dan Emmett, a retired Secret Service agent and author of “Within Arms Length” and “I Am a Secret Service Agent,” said, ""In my view, O'Grady can no longer function with any degree of credibility as an agent and should retire or be dismissed by the Secret Service.""
He added, “Her stated refusal or unwillingness to do what all Secret Service agents have been willing and expected to do since 1902 when the Secret Service began protecting presidents presents the worst possible example for her agents as well as all young agents Service wide. She has at this point rendered herself completely irrelevant as an agent. Few will be willing to work for her or with her.""
The Secret Service is reportedly ""taking appropriate action"" after news broke that O’Grady had made the comments in an October Facebook post. The agency did not say if O’Grady, who is in charge of the Denver office, could be disciplined or even fired, but her comments may be in violation of The Hatch Act. That 1939 law bars certain federal employees from engaging in political activity to promote fairness and nonpartisanship within the workplace. The Secret Service is among the agencies affected by the Hatch Act.
""As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act,” O’Grady wrote. “So I keep quiet and skirt the median. To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides. But this world has changed and I have changed. And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her.""
O'Grady told the Washington Examiner that she took down the posts after two or three days and that she would protect the president.
""It was an internal struggle for me but as soon as I put it up, I thought it was not the sentiment that I needed to share because I care very deeply about the mission,"" she said.
Byrne said simply retracting the statement is not enough.
“At her level, she is special agent in charge of Denver, she has a couple hundred people working under her including agents, technicians, and officers,” he said. “Her job is to run the office, but to provide the manpower if the President comes to Colorado.

229,"The leaders of “sanctuary cities” across the country vowed Wednesday to stand firm on their policies offering protection to illegal immigrants, in the wake of an executive order signed by President Trump threatening to cut off federal funding.
“These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic,” Trump’s executive order said.
Trump vowed to “crack down” on those cities during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security, setting up a showdown between his administration and the nearly 300 communities that have policies helping shield undocumented immigrants from deportation.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he wouldn’t “deviate” from the city’s current approach of offering basic protection to illegal immigrants.
“We’re doing the right thing,” de Blasio said. “We have a city that is working economically, that is more harmonious and that is safer.”
He added, “We’re not going to deviate from that.”
Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who represents parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan, said she was proud that “city officials have made clear they will not be accomplices in enforcing policies that create fear in immigrant communities.”
“New York has always been a city of immigrants and we will not be bullied into dividing against one another,” she said in a written statement.
While there is no one-size-fits-all definition of a sanctuary city, the term loosely refers to places that offer political support and protections to people who are in the U.S. illegally. Trump has vowed since the campaign to confront them over their defiance of federal immigration law, but those cities gave little indication they'd reconsider the policies after Wednesday's signing.
“Shame on him,” Lawrence, Mass., Mayor Daniel Rivera said in a statement. “There’s so many other things to worry about. Nobody in a red state is going to get a job or have their life become better because he victimizes these immigrants.”
Northhampton Mayor David Narkewicz told The Boston Globe he felt stripping funding from sanctuary cities would be easier said than done.
“It’s very easy to campaign, that the king is going to wave his scepter and somehow take away federal funding, but this isn’t the campaign anymore,” he said. “This is a president who functions in a larger government. We’re a government of laws. So it’s a much more difficult process, which I think even his spokesman conceded.”
Trump's White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said earlier the order would direct the DHS secretary to look at funding streams and determine ""how they can be cut off"" for sanctuary districts.
Some of America's biggest cities, including Chicago and the city hosting this week's congressional Republican retreat -- Philadelphia -- are also poised for a fight with the Trump administration.
A spokeswoman for Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney says the city has no plans to change its immigration policy.
“Given that today’s [executive order] was simply a directive and did not even make clear if there were any significant funding streams that the Trump administration could cut off to Philadelphia, we have no plans to change our immigration policy at this time,” Lauren Hitt said in a statement.
She added that Philadelphia has a “responsibility” to keep “undocumented human beings” safe.",neutral
230,"Holding hands, hundreds of protesters opposed to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines took to the streets of Washington Tuesday night for a fresh round of demonstrations after President Trump signed executive orders clearing the way for the controversial projects to move forward.
“There’s a man sitting in that house right now who is not going to stand for anyone other than himself,” Jicarilla Apache Nation member Eryn Wise told the crowd by the White House.
Others chanted, “We’re not going away. Welcome to your fourth day!”
The backlash in D.C. and other cities swiftly signaled that the kind of anti-pipeline demonstrations that took over a swath of North Dakota last year are revving up again.
Only this time, they're going national.
The president, in signing the orders Tuesday, described them as a bid to put Americans back to work. The actions make it easier for TransCanada to construct the Keystone XL pipeline and for Energy Transfer Partners to build the final stretch of the Dakota Access Pipeline.
""It's about time,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement. ""These pipelines will strengthen our nation’s energy supply and help keep energy costs low for American families.""
Proponents say the pipelines will create jobs and reduce reliance on foreign energy. Opponents say the pipelines will harm the environment and could pollute drinking water.
Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, joined several environmental groups in denouncing Trump’s actions.
“Donald Trump has been in office for four days, and he’s already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be,” Brune said in a statement.
Trump said the two pipeline projects would be subject to renegotiation of terms, but made clear that the government – with his approval – would resume consideration for both.
“The Trump administration’s politically motivated decision violates the law and the Tribe will take legal action to fight it,” Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said in a statement, warning of a ""second Flint"" water crisis.
Several-hundred protesters already were making their way back to North Dakota's main protest campsite, where demonstrators clashed last year with law enforcement in an at-times chaotic scene, after Trump's inauguration.
However, their presence at that specific site may be short-lived.
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe called for activists to leave, out of concern for their safety because of predicted seasonal flooding of the river near the area of the camps. The elements have created a dangerous situation. Videos have shown protesters huddled together for warmth and struggling to walk in minus 4-degree weather.
Demonstrators now have until the end of the month to leave, according to a resolution passed by the tribal council in Fort Yates. If they remain, the tribe could call on federal law enforcement officials to have them removed and block re-entry.
The tribe, though, says it will resume its fight in the courtroom.
Other protesters, meanwhile, hit the streets on Tuesday. In Seattle, hundreds gathered in Westlake Park to protest.
“We’re here today as a human family,” Paul Cheyok’ten Wagner, of the Saanich First Nations of Vancouver Island, told Komonews.com. “We’re letting the world know that we will not allow the Dakota Access Pipeline of the XL Pipeline to harm our grandchildren.”
In New York, more than 2,000 people had signed up to attend a protest near Columbus Circle only a few hours after Trump signed the executive actions.
Jane Fonda joined a group of protesters outside Trump Tower. The 79-year-old actress-turned-activist called Trump the “predator-in-chief” and denounced his pipeline plans.
Trump’s executive orders, while expected, mark a major shift from the Obama administration, which had stalled both projects.
“We’re going to put a lot of … steel workers back to work,” Trump said Tuesday. “We’ll build our own pipelines, we will build our own pipes.”
He said the Keystone XL would create 28,000 jobs – a number that is at odds with a 2014 State Department study that projected the pipeline would create 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent ones.
For the Dakota Access Pipeline, proponents estimate it would create 8,000 to 12,000 construction jobs and pump an estimated $156 million in sales and income taxes into the economy. The pipeline is expected to generate an estimated $55 million annually in property taxes in the Dakotas, Iowa and Illinois.
Moments after signing the executive order for the disputed pipelines, Trump ignored a reporter’s question about the Native American protesters and environmentalists who have fiercely opposed it.",positive
231,"President Trump tweeted Tuesday night that he will “send in the Feds” if Chicago doesn’t take care of its gun violence problem – but what could this involve?
Trump tweeted that ""if Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on"" then he would act, but it was not immediately clear what, if anything, he had in mind.
The ability of the federal government to wade into state affairs is deliberately limited as the founders intended, but there are options available to the president.
“Send in the feds” may bring to mind sending troops into Chicago. However, the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 prohibits the federal government from deploying troops to deal with a local matter. The Act was passed to end the use of federal troops to police state-level elections in former Confederate states. However, there are exceptions. President Eisenhower in 1957 sent in the 101st Airborne into Little Rock, Arkansas to quell the civil rights unrest there.
In 2006 Congress revised the law in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, so the president can send troops in order to restore order whenever local and state authorities cannot, which gives Trump more wiggle room. Trump could also federalize the state National Guard and deploy it – Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson all did this. However, this would most likely be a last resort option.
Sending the National Guard into Chicago may seem extreme but it isn’t entirely out of the realm of possibility. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, was asked about such an outcome in August, as the governor of a state can also mobilize the National Guard. However, he nixed the idea and said that while he had discussed the idea with police and the National Guard, he concluded it was not a good idea.
The Chicago Tribune pointed to the possibility of the U.S. attorney coordinating with branches of the federal government. The current attorney for Illinois' Northern District is Zachary Fardon and he has placed solving violent crime at the top of the city’s agenda – although he warned that the city couldn’t arrest its way out of the problem.
Fardon noted that his office and federal agencies including the FBI, DEA and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ""have ramped up their resources to help tamp down this spike in violence."" The Tribune reports that Fardon also announced that federal agencies had launched new crime-fighting programs with city and state officials, though he didn't provide details.
Trump could encourage those agencies to up their game in violence-torn cities. He could, for instance, send FBI agents to be embedded with local law enforcement.
The Tribune also noted that federal prosecutors have used racketeering and gun laws to go after gangs – which are particularly prevalent in the Windy City. Putting higher priority on convicting and imprisoning gang leaders could do a lot to end the violence, although the Tribune noted that breaking up a gang’s command structure can lead to more rivalries and more violence.
Another option for Trump would be to pressure Chiacago to reinstitute policies such as stop-and-frisk by withholding federal funds until they change.",neutral
232,"Senate Democrats, in a bid to seize on President Trump’s inaugural address call for repairing the nation’s infrastructure, have unveiled a $1 trillion plan they say would create 15 million jobs over the next 10 years – though they could face resistance from Republicans uneasy about endorsing a stimulus-style spending bill.
The plan put out by Democrats proposes to spend:
-$210 billion repairing roads and bridges
-$180 billion upgrading rail and bus systems
-$110 billion modernizing the electrical grid
-Billions more for schools, shipping waterways, airports and more
Though former President Obama’s stimulus package and other infrastructure plans were derided by Republicans, Democrats behind the new proposal are hoping to appeal to Trump’s interest in putting Americans to work on vital construction projects.
“He campaigned on a promise of bigger and better infrastructure,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday. “This plan is the way to make it happen.”
Schumer met with Trump and said the president seemed “willing” to work on moving forward.
“We call on the president to persuade his Republican colleagues in the House and Senate to drop their opposition to investing in infrastructure and get on board with this plan,” Schumer said.
But the plan already is facing resistance from Capitol Hill Republicans.
“I don’t think we ought to borrow a trillion dollars and plus up a bunch of federal accounts, incur a lot of additional debt, and don’t build a lot of projects to speak of,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday. “So I can tell you what I’m against – which is a replication of the Obama stimulus package in 2009.”
Harry Zieve Cohen, a research associate at the Hudson Institute, the same center-right think tank where Trump’s nominee for Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao works, told Fox News that everyone will be forced to compromise.
“I wouldn’t be surprised to see some sort of compromise where there is increased private spending,” Cohen told Fox News. “This is an opening salvo from the Democrats trying to test the president -- they know there are some differences on his views of infrastructure versus that of the Republican caucus in terms of how this should be funded.”
According to Cohen, infrastructure can be funded one of two ways: through direct government spending, or by incentivizing private firms to construct or repair infrastructure with the help of a tax break or other benefit.
“I’d imagine both of those things would appeal to Trump,” Cohen said.
Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., told Fox News there needs to be a “limitation” on the proposal.
“Infrastructure plans are great – they lead to jobs – we need to do something,” Walker told Fox News. “But we can’t throw out the kitchen sink just to be able to try to get into the spirit of bipartisanship.”
But McConnell said Republicans are willing to consider proposals coming from the Trump administration, which would include, if confirmed, his wife Elaine Chao in the Transportation Department.
“I hope it will be something credibly paid for,” McConnell said. “We have a $21 trillion debt, but I think we would all like to tackle infrastructure in a credible way and hopefully that’s what they’ll recommend.”
Trump’s own plan is expected to offer tax credits to businesses that join in public-private partnerships to restore infrastructure. Throughout the campaign, Trump promised to both rebuild America’s infrastructure and reduce the national debt, but doing both simultaneously could prove difficult.
“We have to pay attention to [the deficit and national debt],” Walker told Fox News. “If we are willing to sign off on something that even we consider astronomical numbers, there has to be strong evidence that this does not continue to add to the burden.”

233,"Two Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation Tuesday that would prevent President Trump from launching a nuclear weapon without a obtaining a congressional declaration of war.
Foreign Policy reported that the bill was introduced by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. The article notes that Lieu has a paper sign outside his office that reads, “Alternative Fact Free Zone.”
Under current law, the U.S. president can order a first-use nuclear strike even if the U.S. is not under nuclear attack.
Trump was asked by ABC News Wednesday about the responsibility of receiving the nuclear codes and responded that it was a “very sobering moment."" “It’s very, very, very, scary in a sense.”
During the campaign, Hillary Clinton made it a point hit Trump on his temperament and what she called his erratic use of Twitter. She said, “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.”
Markey said in a statement that nuclear war is the “gravest risk to human survival,"" and he is concerned that Trump suggested in the past that he would consider a launch against terrorists.
Markey was likely referring to Trump's comments in March, when he was asked a hypothetical question about an ISIS strike and responded, “I would never take any of my cards off the table.”
Trump was also criticized during the campaign when he said, “Let it be an arms race” with Russia.
The bill has gained support from various global disarmament groups and former-Secretary of Defense William Perry, who served under President Clinton.
In August, The New York Times wrote extensively on the president's responsiblity with nuclear codes. The report said that it is up to the president to decide whether a nuclear attack on the U.S. was real, and, in turn, could have only minutes to decide if it warranted a nuclear response. The sitting president could launch as many as 925 warheads—about the equivalent of 17,000 Hiroshima bombs.
“There’s no veto once the president has ordered a strike,” Franklin C. Miller, a nuclear specialist who held White House and Defense Department posts for 31 years, told The Times. “The president and only the president has the authority to order the use of nuclear weapons.”
The New York Times report said a spokesman for the National Security Council refused to say if there is anyone in the chain of command who could overrule a president’s order.
The Independent newspaper reported that, in the event of a U.S. nuclear strike, Trump would essentially be giving his Secretary of Defense the authority to authorize the launch. If his secretary refuses, he could be fired and the president would turn to the second-in-command.

234,"An electrical subcontractor who worked on the Trump International Hotel in Washington has sued a company owned by President Donald Trump for more than $2 million, alleging it was not fully paid.
AES Electrical filed its lawsuit in the District of Columbia Superior Court, the latest in a string of lawsuits involving Trump's renovation of the historic Old Post Office building a few blocks from the White House.
AES, a California company doing business locally under the name Freestate Electrical Construction Co., alleged that it bore increased expenses last year because of change orders and other demands from Trump's staff. AES said it was told to accelerate the pace of work so that the then-Republican presidential candidate could hold a televised media event to celebrate the ""soft opening"" of the luxury hotel prior to the November election.
A statement issued by the Trump Organization said that such business disputes are not uncommon during the close-out phase of construction projects of the scale and complexity of the project.
""The Trump Organization has invested over $200 million into the redevelopment of the historic Old Post Office and is incredibly proud of what is now considered to be one the most iconic hotels anywhere in the country,"" the statement said.
AES said its workers were required to work overtime hours for 50 consecutive days to finish the electrical and fire alarm work at the building before the campaign event. Without the extra work, the company said the building would not have met fire codes and would not have been permitted to open.
Trump's campaign orchestrated a lavish ribbon-cutting event at the hotel, which the candidate used to laud his own business acumen. Trump claimed the hotel was opening earlier than scheduled and under budget.
The lawsuit alleged that Trump has saved money by refusing to pay his bills, instead offering to pay AES about one-third of the invoiced amount.
""Trump's actions in refusing to pay for work performed, after a project has opened, is a repeated practice of the Trump organizations on various projects; evidencing a typical business practice meant to force subcontractors to accept `pennies on the dollar' with respect to amounts owed for the cost of work performed,"" the lawsuit alleged.
The complaint, filed last week, was first reported by Politico on Wednesday. AES is also suing two of Trump's primary construction contractors.
Trump's long history of refusing to pay vendors and contractors was the subject of numerous news stories last year. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton sought to make it a campaign issue, including airing a television commercial that featured an architect who said his small business was nearly bankrupted when Trump refused to pay him for designing a club house at one of his golf courses.
Trump's hotel in Washington served as a hub of inaugural activities and has proved controversial for what top Democrats and some ethics advisers see as the new president's conflicts of interest.
Trump's lease with the federal government to develop and operate the hotel expressly prohibits any elected official from benefiting from the property. So far, Trump has not divested from the project. The government's General Services Administration has declined to comment on the apparent contract violation that occurred when Trump took office last week.",positive
235,"Even as President Trump was poised to put an end to sanctuary cities, Chicago's teachers union demanded that the Windy City's public schools become a safe haven for undocumented students.
The call, combined with Mayor Rahm Emanuel's insistence that his city continue to defy federal immigration authorities, puts Chicago front and center in the looming sanctuary battle.
“Schools need to be the first point of safety for students traumatized by raids, deportations, discrimination, hate crimes and persecution by police and from other acts of violence,” said Viveka Ray-Mazumder, a leader of a coalition of community groups and public employees.
In a written resolution, the coalition is demanding that the Chicago school district “not assist or facilitate the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) access to school databases, facilities, equipment, personnel…” and also that the district “not cooperate with ICE, DHS, or other agencies.”
Just as sanctuary cities refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities when they identify illegal immigrants, schools that so designate themselves would decline to share immigration information about students.
Trump has said he will move to withhold federal funding to sanctuary cities, but it is not clear what his administration would do about school districts that, for example, don't respond to a warrant on a student.
Critics argue sanctuary cities and schools can create a haven for criminals and is just an excuse for underperformance.
“It is about them trying to cling to power because they cannot defend performance, so they have to misdirect your attention away from somebody allegedly who is coming for you,” said conservative radio host Dan Proft. “Unless you’re a violent criminal who is here illegally, they’re not coming for you.”
The Chicago public school district would join a list of dozens of self-declared sanctuary school districts across the country. However, CPS is one of the nation’s largest districts with more than 380,000 students, so it would set a large precedent if it did pursue becoming a sanctuary.
Emanuel is scheduled to publicly respond to President Trump’s executive orders on immigration and sanctuary cities on Wednesday afternoon.",positive
236,"The leader of a Russian-American business was reportedly behind some of the salacious material contained in the discredited dossier of President Donald Trump.
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that statements made by Sergei Millian, 38, about Trump’s relationship with Russia were relayed by an intermediary to the British ex-spy who leaked the dossier.
A person familiar with the dossier told the Journal that some of the unverified allegations that allegedly came from Millian were that of blackmail that could be used against Trump and the claim Trump aides worked with Russia in the hacking of prominent Democrats.
Trump and Russian officials have dismissed the claims made in the dossier. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said earlier this month that intel officials did not make “any judgment that the information in this document is reliable.”
Former CIA Director John Brennan and Trump had a spat over the dossier earlier this month too. Brennan rejected the suggestion that he may have leaked the unsubstantiated dossier that claimed Russia had compromising allegations about Trump.
“First of all, this is not intelligence community information,” Brennan said Monday. Brennan said he did not read the document and, according to the Wall Street Journal, gave it no particular credence.
Millian, a Belarus-born American citizen, has claimed to have helped market some of Trump’s business properties to prospective Russian buyers. He posted several photos of himself at VIP inauguration events last week and told the paper in an email the dossier was “fake news” and “an attempt to distract the future president from real work.”
Trump Organization executive Michael Cohen also slammed the dossier and was surprised that Millian could’ve been the source for some of the claims. Cohen said there was “not an ounce of truth” to Millian’s claims to have had a relationship with the president. Cohen said they met once for a photo-op.
Trump on Twitter has openly questioned if the intelligence community was behind leaking the memos to the press. BuzzFeed released the documents in bulk this month despite the site’s own disclaimer that much of the information could not be verified.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the dossier, saying Trump’s enemies were “worse than prostitutes.”

237,"President Trump is set Wednesday to take the first steps toward building his “big, beautiful wall” to keep illegal immigrants out – but a more pressing issue may be dealing with the nearly 2 million criminal aliens who’ve already made it inside America’s borders.
At least 925,000 illegal immigrants had been targeted for deportation but remained in the U.S., as of a 2015 estimate from Immigration and Custom Enforcement. A Department of Homeland Security study, however, said that number is more than doubled – to a staggering 1.9 million – when applied to all criminal aliens in the U.S., not just those ticketed to be kicked out. A criminal alien is any noncitizen – in the U.S. legally or illegally – convicted of a crime. But The Center for Immigration Studies’ Jessica Vaughan has said the vast majority of those aliens are indeed illegals.
“It shows you how dysfunctional our interior immigration system is,” Vaughan told Fox News.
TRUMP TO MAKE GOOD ON BORDER WALL PROMISE
Trump began his candidacy by promising the mass deportation of illegals; however, as he emerged as the GOP nominee, and then eventually won the presidency, he softened his position to focus on criminal aliens.
Trump’s actions Wednesday will be the first step in that process. Among other orders, Trump is likely to curb funding to so-called sanctuary cities, beef up the number of border patrol agents and stop the controversial catch-and-release practice in which immigration agents release illegals awaiting removal hearings.
“They’ve been allowed to stay here and take advantage of our generous immigration court system,” Vaughan said. “But the result of letting people go instead of keeping them in custody is they disappear into the woodwork and don’t fear any consequences.”
Of the 925,193 illegal immigrants who’ve evaded a scheduled deportation, 179,040 had a criminal conviction – and 172,135 of those remained at large, according to ICE figures.
In 2015 alone, 19,723 criminal illegal immigrants were released back into the U.S. – including 208 convicted of homicides and more than 900 with sex crime convictions, an ICE analysis showed. Those 19,723 illegals combined for a total of 64,197 convictions.
TRUMP PROMISES MAJOR INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED VOTER FRAUD
“Judges are ordering people removed, but they are either skipping out on those orders or ICE is being told not to bother pursuing them because they’re being told they should focus only on people who’ve committed very serious crimes,” Vaughan said.
And the numbers are trending upward. From 2012 to 2015, illegal immigrants set for deportation who remained in the U.S. grew by 20 percent.
“[Obama administration policies] contributed to this sense that our government isn’t serious about enforcing immigration laws,” Vaughan said. “And that’s why I think the executive orders coming today from President Trump are going to go a long way toward changing the calculation that illegal immigrants make – that they can just get away with ignoring a removal order.”
But Vaughan cautioned that, despite Wednesday’s flurry of presidential orders, the interior immigration issue is no quick fix.
“These people didn’t arrive overnight and this problem didn’t happen overnight, so it’s going to take a few years to make a big dent in that number,” Vaughan said. “But today President Trump is getting the immigration enforcement system back on track.”",negative
238,"The White House press office Tuesday asked reporters covering the Trump administration to give the president's children a wide berth after his 10-year-old son Barron was the subject of an insensitive tweet.
""It is a longstanding tradition that the children of Presidents are afforded the opportunity to grow up outside of the political spotlight,"" the press office said in a statement to the media. ""The White House fully expects this tradition to continue. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.""
The statement came one day after NBC indefinitely suspended ""Saturday Night Live"" writer Katie Rich for a tweet mocking Barron Trump during Friday's inauguration festivities. An outcry on social media followed, with many calling for a boycott of the TV show.
Rich later deleted the tweet and deactivated her Twitter account, but then reactivated it Monday to say she wanted to ""sincerely apologize"" for the ""insensitive"" tweet and ""deeply regret"" her actions.
Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton expressed her support for Barron Trump, telling the Associated Press that he ""deserves the chance every child does — to be a kid.""
Barron Trump is expected to attend school in New York through the end of the academic year, when he will join his parents in Washington.
In addition to Barron, President Trump has four adult children and eight grandchildren.

239,"President Donald Trump will begin rolling out executive actions on immigration Wednesday, beginning with steps to build his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to two administration officials. He's also expected to target so-called sanctuary cities and is reviewing proposals that would restrict the flow of refugees to the United States.
The president is expected to sign the first actions -- including the measure to jumpstart construction of the wall -- Wednesday during a trip to the Department of Homeland Security. Additional actions will be rolled out over the next few days, according to one official.
Trump is said to still be weighing the details of plans to restrict refugees coming to the U.S. The current proposal includes at least a four-month halt on all refugee admissions, as well as temporary ban on people coming from some Muslim majority countries, according to a representative of a public policy organization that monitors refugee issues. The person was briefed on the details of that proposed action by a government official and outlined the expected steps for The Associated Press.
The officials and the public policy organization's representative insisted on anonymity in order to outline the plans ahead of Trump's official announcements.
Trump campaigned on pledges to tighten U.S. immigration policies, including beefing up border security and stemming the flow of refugees. He also called for halting entry to the U.S. from Muslim countries, but later shifted the policy to a focus on what he called ""extreme vetting"" for those coming from countries with terrorism ties.
While the specific of Trump's orders were unclear, both administration officials said Wednesday's actions would focus in part on the president's plans to construct a wall along the southern border with Mexico. He's also expected to move forward with plans to curb funding of cities that don't arrest or detain immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, which could cost individual jurisdictions millions of dollars.
Trump's insistence that Mexico would pay for the wall was among his most popular proposals on the campaign trail, sparking enthusiastic cheers at his raucous rallies. Mexico has repeatedly said it will not pay for any border wall.
Earlier this month, Trump said the building project would initially be paid for with a congressionally approved spending bill and Mexico will eventually reimburse the U.S., though he has not specified how he would guarantee payments.
Trump will meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the White House next week.
In claiming authority to build a wall, Trump may rely on a 2006 law that authorized several hundred miles of fencing along the 2,000-mile frontier. That bill led to the construction of about 700 miles of various kinds of fencing designed to block both vehicles and pedestrians.
The Secure Fence Act was signed by then-President George W. Bush and the majority of the fencing in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California was built before he left office. The last remnants were completed after President Barack Obama took office in 2009.
The Trump administration also must adhere to a decades-old border treaty with Mexico that limits where and how structures can be built along the border. The 1970 treaty requires that structures cannot disrupt the flow of the rivers, which define the U.S.-Mexican border along Texas and 24 miles in Arizona, according to The International Boundary and Water Commission, a joint U.S.-Mexican agency that administers the treaty.
It appeared as though the refugee restrictions were still to be finalized. The person briefed on the proposals said they included a ban on entry to the U.S. for at least 30 days from countries including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, though the person cautioned the details could still change.
There is also likely to be an exception in the refugee stoppage for those fleeing religious persecution if their religion is a minority in their country. That exception could cover Christians fleeing Muslim-majority nations.
As president, Trump can use an executive order to halt refugee processing. President George W. Bush used that same power in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Refugee security vetting was reviewed and the process was restarted several months later.
Other executive actions expected Wednesday include bolstering border patrol agents and ending what Republicans have argued is a catch-and-release system at the border. Currently, some immigrants caught crossing the border illegally are given notices to report back to immigration officials at a later date.
If Trump's actions would result in those caught being immediately jailed, the administration would have to grapple with how to pay for jail space to detain everyone and what to do with children caught crossing the border with their parents.",neutral
240,"President Trump signed executive orders on Tuesday effectively reviving the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, as a major builder said it will reapply to build one of the projects which had been stalled by the Obama administration under pressure from environmental and other groups.
The president said the projects would be subject to a “renegotiation of the terms.” But he made clear the government was resuming consideration for both pipelines, describing them as a potential boon to construction workers.
“We’re going to put a lot of … steel workers back to work,” Trump said. “We’ll build our own pipelines, we will build our own pipes.”
Builder TransCanada said Tuesday afternoon it was ""preparing the application"" for the Keystone XL pipeline.
""We appreciate the President of the United States inviting us to re-apply for KXL,"" TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said in a statement.
""KXL creates thousands of well-paying construction jobs and would generate tens of millions of dollars in annual property taxes to counties along the route as well as more than $3 billion to the U.S. GDP,"" Cunha added.
According to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Trump directed agencies to approve it without delay -- and told agencies to expedite reviews and approvals for the remaining parts of the Dakota project.
“There’s an energy revolution that’s going to happen in this country,” he said.
The president also signed three other orders related to pipeline construction, including one expediting the environmental permitting process for infrastructure projects and one directing the Commerce Department to maximize the use of U.S. steel.
Looking ahead, Trump also announced he planned to nominate a justice for the Supreme Court next week, moving swiftly to try to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The president was summoning top senators to the White House later Tuesday to discuss his upcoming nomination.
The moves on the pipelines had been widely expected, as Trump last year blasted his predecessor for effectively blocking the projects.
Republican allies hailed Tuesday’s orders, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying in a statement, “It’s about time.”
North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer said: “Today’s executive orders affirm President Trump’s respect for the rule of law and his support for responsible infrastructure development, energy production and job creation.”
Former President Obama stopped the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in late 2015, declaring it would have undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal that was a centerpiece of his environmental legacy. The pipeline would run from Canada to Nebraska where it would connect to existing lines running to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. The U.S. government needs to approve the pipeline because it would cross the nation's northern border.
Separately, late last year, the Army Corps of Engineers declined to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe, saying alternative routes needed to be considered. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters say the project threatens drinking water and Native American sites, though Energy Transfer Partners, the company that wants to build the pipeline, disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe.
The pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. The project had been the subject of fierce protests until the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in.
The moves are likely to spark a new fight with environmentalists. Even before Trump’s orders were official, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune put out a statement blasting what he called the “dangerous” decision.
“The Keystone pipeline was rejected because it was not in the country’s interest, and the environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline was ordered because of the threats it poses to the Standing Rock Sioux. Nothing has changed. These pipelines were a bad idea then and they’re a bad idea now,” he said.
The moves come as Trump makes the economy and jobs the centerpiece of his administration’s first week in office.
He met Tuesday morning with representatives from the auto industry including GM and Ford, after meeting a day earlier, separately, with business and union leaders.
The pipelines were among the few issues that put the Obama administration at odds with labor unions, some of whom have voiced hope the Trump administration can work with them to promote job creation. Trump said Tuesday during his meeting with auto industry bosses that he considers himself an environmentalist, but called current regulations ""out of control.""
The pipeline orders follow earlier executive actions covering everything from trade to ObamaCare.
Trump on Monday signed measures withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and instituting a hiring freeze for most of the federal government. He also ordered federal agencies on his first day in office to ease the regulatory burden of the Affordable Care Act.

244,"After an 11-month political standstill on filling the Supreme Court vacancy, the wait may be worth it for conservative activists eager to see President Trump choose a like-minded nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.
According to Trump, the decision is coming soon.
""I'll be making my decision this week, we'll be announcing next week,"" Trump said, after meeting Tuesday with Senate leaders from both parties to discuss the vacancy. ""We'll pick a truly great Supreme Court justice.""
This, as sources close to the selection process tell Fox News the list of possible candidates is now down to three names, all of them federal appeals court judges: Judge William Pryor in Alabama, Judge Neil Gorsuch in Colorado, and Judge Thomas Hardiman in Pennsylvania.
Trump has met personally with all three, sources say.
Trump said at a press conference last week before he took office that a decision would come within two weeks of his being sworn in. Press Secretary Sean Spicer reinforced that rough timeline on Monday, saying the nomination remains a ""priority.""
The three judges in play were all on the original list of 21 candidates Trump announced as a presidential candidate last year, and supporters tout their conservative credentials:
-- Judge William Pryor, who sits on the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, with chambers in Birmingham, Ala.
Pryor is close to Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, the Alabama senator. Born in 1962, he was initially given a recess appointment to the appeals court. Senate Democrats then tried to block Pryor's subsequent nominations, citing his strong criticism of the Roe v. Wade decision establishing a woman's right to an abortion. He called it the ""worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.""
-- Judge Neil Gorsuch, on the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, with chambers in Denver
Born 1967, he went to Harvard Law School, then clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. He went into private practice in Washington before joining the Bush Justice Department. His mother is Anne Burford, the first female administrator at the EPA. Gorsuch wrote the book ""The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia.""
His name has been rising in Trump's circle in recent weeks.
-- Judge Thomas Hardiman, 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, with chambers in Pittsburgh
Born 1965, he saw the Supreme Court affirm his 2010 ruling that a jail policy of strip-searching all those arrested does not violate the Fourth Amendment's ban on ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" Hardiman sits on the same court as Trump's sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who despite the family ties is not being considered for any high court vacancy.
The fact Hardiman did not attend an Ivy League school (as a Notre Dame undergrad and Georgetown Law grad) may appeal to Trump's populist leanings, as could the fact he drove a taxi to finance his education.
Three other federal appeals court judges touted by their supporters include Diane Sykes, based in Wisconsin, Judge Raymond Kethledge of Michigan and Raymond Gruender of Missouri.
All are appointees of George W. Bush, a sign that judicial picks can have a far-reaching impact years, even decades, after presidents leaving elected office. Federal judges serve for life, and seven of the eight current justices all served in lower federal appeals courts.
Some state supreme court justices are on Trump's broader list of 21, but sources say federal judges have a proven record of cases from which to vet, and the fact they have been through a congressional confirmation before is an advantage.
Trump's outreach with Senate leaders follows Vice President Pence's more low-key meeting with two moderate Democrats last week.
White House officials see Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana as key to ensuring a filibuster-proof majority to confirm what is sure to be a conservative choice.
""Today was really about talking about our legislative agenda, but also meeting with members of the Senate to get their input on the President's decision about filling the vacancy on the Supreme Court,"" Pence said after his meetings.
But Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has said he is prepared to fight.
""Let's see who they nominate,"" he said earlier this month. ""If they're in the mainstream we'll give them a very careful look. If they're out of the mainstream we'll oppose them tooth and nail.""
Feelings remain raw among many on the left, after President Obama's choice to replace Scalia languished without Senate action, part of a deliberate move by Republicans to wait out the president’s term. Judge Merrick Garland this month returned to his old job on the D.C. Circuit federal appeals court.
A go-slow approach could complicate the White House's goal of seating a justice by mid-April when the last oral arguments of the term would begin.
White House Counsel Don McGahn is leading the vetting process, with input from senior administration legal and political advisers, including Sessions. Outside conservative advisers include Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society and Jim DeMint of the Heritage Foundation.
Sources close to the selection process did not rule out other names being added late in what has emerged as a fast-moving, dynamic process.

245,"President Trump has decided to retain controversial FBI Director James Comey, two law enforcement sources confirmed to Fox News, just months after Comey's revelations about Hillary Clinton’s emails twice rocked the presidential race.
Comey has already alerted members of the FBI workforce that Trump asked him to stay on the job. He's currently serving a 10-year term that expires in 2023.
Comey had been alternately praised and lambasted by Trump on the campaign trail. Tuesday’s news means Trump will avert a new confirmation fight and also helps the president avoid any appearance of impropriety.
Comey reportedly is investigating Trump associates’ ties to Russia, and some agents also may still be looking at The Clinton Foundation, as Fox News has previously reported.
During a White House reception on Sunday, Trump greeted Comey warmly. ""Oh, and there's James! He's become more famous than me,"" he said.
Republicans had decried Comey’s move in July to call Clinton’s secret server “extremely careless” but nonetheless legal.
However, it was Democrats who cried foul when, in October, Comey informed Congress he was again investigating Clinton emails due to the emergence of new evidence.
On the Sunday before the presidential election, Comey said the investigation was complete and Clinton again had been cleared. In the wake of Trump’s Nov. 8 victory, however, Clinton and many members of her team have blamed Comey’s actions late in the race for the former secretary of state’s loss.

246,"Businesses around the world bearing U.S. President Donald Trump's name face an increased risk now that he is in the White House, security experts warn, especially as several are in areas previously targeted by violence.
As Trump remains a brand overseas, criminal gangs or militants could target buildings bearing his name in gold, abduct workers associated with his enterprises for ransom or worse, they say.
""They may kidnap a Trump worker and not even want to negotiate,"" aiming for publicity instead, said Colin P. Clarke, a political scientist with the RAND Corporation who studies terrorism and international criminal networks.
Predicting an attack keeps police, intelligence agencies and security experts awake at night around the world — and, by its very nature, it remains speculative.
U.S. brands have been targeted in overseas violence before, but they never belonged to a president. That's the difference. Trump becoming America's 45th president presents a unique challenge given the range of his international business interests.
Asked about security issues, the Trump Organization said in a statement it has ""extensive protocols in place at our Trump-owned and -managed properties"" in the United States and abroad.
""Our team continues to work very closely with local law enforcement,"" the statement said. ""We are also working in tandem with the local developers at Trump-branded properties worldwide to ensure that all residents, guests and associates remain safe and secure."" The organization did not elaborate.
While Trump has said he will put his business assets in a trust and hand over management control of his company to his two adult sons and a longtime Trump Organization executive, it's still his name on the projects.
That hasn't worried Kim Ok Kyu, who lives in a Trump-branded apartment tower in Seoul, South Korea. She said security at her building is quite good, with many guards and strict restrictions on outsiders entering the building
""Terror? I don't think about it. I just hope my home prices go up,"" Kim said.
But other properties are in areas that have seen violence, like Trump Towers Istanbul, the Turkish city hit hard by a string of bomb and gun attacks carried out by the Islamic State group. Flags and banners around the site bear the president's name, while private security guards man X-ray machines and metal detectors at its entrances, a standard practice in the city.
In Bali, where bombs planted by the Islamic extremist group Jemaah Islamiyah targeting bar-goers killed 202 people in 2002, Trump's organization has licensed the president's name to a planned luxury resort. Bali police spokesman Hengky Widjaja said no one had requested extra security for the property and authorities had no plans to increase their presence there.
A Trump-named residential tower is under construction in the Indian city of Mumbai, which was hit by a 2008 terror attack blamed on the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba that killed 166 people. Mumbai police spokesman Ashok Dudhe said he had no knowledge of any additional security around the tower.
Another tower is being built in Manila in the Philippines, a nation where Abu Sayyaf militants conduct frequent kidnappings for ransom and where President Rodrigo Duterte wages a brutal crackdown on drug dealers that has killed thousands. Philippine police say they haven't monitored any specific threat toward Trump properties, though a tower rising in Manila sits in an area under an intensified security watch after Duterte declared a ""state of lawlessness"" following a September bombing.
Even Trump's soon-to-open golf course in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates could be a target, despite the fact the Gulf Arab nation has largely escaped the violence gripping its Mideast neighbors. In the UAE's capital of Abu Dhabi, an American school teacher was stabbed to death in a mall bathroom by an extremist in December 2014. Authorities also have imprisoned others over disrupted terror plots in the country, which hosts some 5,000 members of the U.S. military.
Dubai police have declined to discuss safety on the golf course while the developer says it plans no additional security there. The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi did not respond to questions about the golf course, which Trump's children are expected to soon visit.
All of the Trump properties should be looked at by outside security consultants, said Christopher A. Hagon, a managing partner of The Incident Management Group and a former London police officer with experience in diplomatic security. However, he acknowledged such commercial properties can't be surrounded by concrete blast walls and controlled like a U.S. Embassy.
""There is no complete answer to these things unless you've got a military encampment and you can do anything you like,"" Hagon said. ""You've got to make compromises, but hope those compromises won't weaken the overall approach.""
Away from the properties themselves, employees could be threatened, robbed or held captive, experts warn. Under U.S. law, the Secret Service is authorized to protect the president, the vice president and their immediate families. That would include his sons Eric and Donald Jr., who will run the Trump Organization under the plan announced by the president at a news conference last week.
Already, the Secret Service and the New York police have provided security in and around Trump Tower in Manhattan as the president lives and works there.
When asked about the Trump Organization, Secret Service spokeswoman Cathy Milhoan said the agency does ""not comment on our protective operations."" However, that Secret Service protection extends anywhere the president and his immediate family travels.
The U.S. intelligence community already has a duty to warn American citizens and others if it uncovers information about impending threats, which would include Trump's businesses.
In 2015, National Intelligence Director James Clapper set formal guidelines for how the intelligence community does that if it learns of impending threats of killing, serious bodily harm or kidnapping.
""This includes threats where the target is an institution, place of business, structure or location,"" according to Clapper's directive.
Those threats become more serious if Trump's work intersects with his duties in the Oval Office and a militant group decides to ""mock, torment or tease"" him with a kidnapped employee, Clarke said.
He added: ""If an executive from Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan or Exxon Mobil gets kidnapped, it's news, but it's not the president's company.""",negative
247,"President Trump on Monday issued an executive order implementing a hiring freeze across the federal government, with exceptions only for military, national security or public safety personnel.
Trump had raised the possibility of a hiring freeze during the campaign. At a news conference Monday, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the freeze ensures taxpayers get effective and efficient government and said it ""counters the dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years.""
“Some people are working two, three jobs just to get by. And to see money get wasted in Washington on a job that is duplicative is insulting to the hard work that they do to pay their taxes,” Spicer said.
The New York Times reported that Trump called it a stopgap way to control the growth of government until his administration comes up with a long-term solution.
“In carrying out this memorandum, I ask that you seek efficient use of existing personnel and funds to improve public services and the delivery of these services,” Trump wrote in the memorandum, according to the paper.
Statistics from the Office of Personnel Management, though, show that the number of executive branch employees hasn't been this low since 1965, and that the number of employees has stayed more or less steady in the last 15 years.
The full effect of a hiring freeze is unclear. According to OPM, the federal government hired 221,000 workers in fiscal 2015, the most recent year for which data is available. The number excludes uniformed military personnel. But roughly a third of those hired were military veterans, who enjoy hiring preferences in the federal government.
Trump signs executive order withdrawing US from TPP trade deal
Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, whose district includes many federal workers, said Monday that the government actually needs to increase its capacity to handle certain issues, like cybersecurity.

248,"Between his vows to replace ObamaCare, build a border wall and renegotiate trade pacts, President Trump’s inbox is mighty full his first week in office.
But one of the biggest challenges will be the Department of Veterans Affairs, where massive problems persist – many in the same hospital that was the epicenter of the waiting-list scandal that rocked the agency, and shocked the public, in 2014.
“Until Congress passes strong accountability measures, VA employees from top to bottom will have little incentive to change this toxic culture,” said Mark Lucas, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America, a veterans’ advocacy group.
A recent survey of employees at the Phoenix facility reported employees have little confidence in the integrity of their supervisors -- findings Lucas called “unsurprising.” Two government audits also found little improvement and costly inefficiencies in the agency as a whole.
Trump, who vowed during the campaign to overhaul the scandal-scarred department, has nominated Dr. David Shulkin, a VA undersecretary in the Obama administration, to take over.
If confirmed, Shulkin and Trump together will confront problems that extend well beyond morale issues.
The Government Accountability Office for the third year reportedly will place the VA health system on its “high risk” list when it’s released in February, because of continued problems of waste, fraud or mismanagement. The forthcoming report will say the VA has showed “only limited progress” since the scandal erupted.
The VA Office of Inspector General also reported earlier this month that in 2015, the VA awarded more than $177 million in improper relocation or retention bonuses based on inaccurate information to 238 different employees, many of them executives. The report blamed the VA for “ineffective oversight processes to ensure compliance,” and “ineffective procedures to recoup funds from individuals with outstanding recruitment and relocation incentive service obligations.”
And the January survey of employees at the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in Phoenix – which has had seven directors since 2014 revelations about VA officials falsifying patient wait times as some died waiting for care – found fewer than one-third of employees feel their supervisors have integrity or that whistleblowers would be protected.
Trump’s 10-point plan to reform the VA included firing bad employees; creating a special commission to investigate cover-ups; and ensuring veterans have the option of VA vouchers for private health care.
The department clearly is still high risk. Yet some of Trump’s goals already are in the process of being realized, said Joe Chenille, executive director for the veterans advocacy group AmVets.
“We have gone from 19 percent getting care from outside sources, paid for by the VA, to 31 percent,” Chenelly told Fox News. “My prediction is a surge of people will want care outside the system.”
Shulkin, who has experience as a hospital CEO, came to the agency with now-former VA Secretary Bob McDonald to make reforms after the scandal, and has the confidence right now of the Trump administration.
“Dr. Shulkin is a nationally-recognized turnaround artist, health care leader, and passionate veterans advocate who is eager to transform the VA and will be able to do so in the Trump administration,” Trump spokesman David White said. “If confirmed, Dr. Shulkin will be ready on day one to enact President Trump’s 10-point plan to end mismanagement and incompetence at the VA, and ensure our veterans get the timely, quality care and support they deserve.”
A VA spokeswoman declined to comment and deferred to the Trump team.
A new VA secretary isn’t enough, though, said Lucas of the CVA.
“These are problems that arose as a result of a system that is set up to fail, a system no one leader can change without meaningful reforms from Congress,” Lucas said. “The VA needs to be transparent with veterans and taxpayers about its performance and how money is being spent. But most importantly, veterans deserve to be empowered with choice over where and when to see a doctor.”
In September, RimaAnn Nelson, became the seventh director of the Phoenix veterans health system since the 2014 scandal. Nelson is no stranger to other VA controversies. She previously was director of the St. Louis system, where an inspector general report determined 1,812 patients were potentially exposed to hepatitis and HIV infections because of breaches in cleaning and sterilization of medical equipment.",negative

“They’re trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don’t want to have happen, so any regulations going forward, contracts, grants, hires, they want to make sure to look at them first,” Ebell told ProPublica on Monday. “This may be a little wider than some previous administrations, but it’s very similar to what others have done.”

251,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer dug in Tuesday on President Trump’s claim to congressional leaders that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton last November because between 3 million and 5 million ""illegals"" cast ballots – even as House Speaker Paul Ryan pushed back.
“I’ve seen no evidence to that effect. I’ve made that very, very clear,” Ryan said earlier Tuesday.
But Spicer, asked repeatedly by reporters about the issue at Tuesday’s briefing, said Trump believes this to be the case.
“It was a comment he made on a longstanding belief,” Spicer said. “… He believes what he believes based on the information he’s been provided.”
Spicer said Trump remains “comfortable” with his Electoral College victory, which handed him the presidency regardless of the popular vote totals.
Pressed on whether the administration would pursue an investigation into illegal immigrants voting given Trump’s beliefs, Spicer said: “Maybe we will.” He later backed off the suggestion, saying only that anything is possible.
Trump made the claim during a meeting with congressional leaders Monday, though he’s made similar assertions before.
In late November, Trump tweeted that he had ""won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.""
At the time, multiple law enforcement sources told Fox News that there was no evidence to support Trump's claims.
Trump defeated Clinton in the Electoral College, collecting 304 votes to her 227. However, Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million ballots.
Spicer said Tuesday that Trump’s claim was based on “studies and evidence.”
Spicer did not provide hard data to back up the claim, citing only a 2008 study that called for updating voter rolls but did not conclude there has been pervasive election fraud.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Tuesday blasted Trump over the comments, which he described as falsehoods, and said the administration ought to talk about jobs.
Spicer, though, said their focus right now is getting Americans back to work – something Trump has addressed in a flurry of executive actions including measures Tuesday aimed at reviving stalled pipeline projects.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, filed the lawsuit in the Southern District of New York and claims Trump is violating a clause in the Constitution that prohibits his businesses from receiving anything of value from foreign governments. Because Trump didn’t divest his businesses, the group claims he’s now receiving gifts from foreign governments via guests and events at his hotels, leases in his buildings and real estate deals abroad.

The group of roughly 100 Southwest Airlines and NetJets pilots will voice their opposition to a December 2 decision by the Transportation Department to allow Norwegian Air International to service the United States, arguing the airline can undercut labor costs because its headquarters is in Ireland.
Critics of that strategy call the business tactic a “flag of convenience scheme.”
Norwegian Air International is a subsidiary of low-cost European carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle, based in Norway.
“Even before President Trump was in office, we supported his pro-worker mantra,” Chip Hancock, a Southwest Airlines Pilots’ Association official, said Monday. “He’s looking out for American workers.”
He and Coley George, of NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots, said they were hearted by Trump on Monday -- the start of his first full week in office -- for getting the United States out the Obama-backed international trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
“Another bad trade deal approved by Obama,” George said.
The pilots and their unions have until January 29 to get Trump to stop the change.
Norwegian started asking to provide air service to the U.S. as far back as 2013, amid objections from airline carriers, unions and others that the change could undercut labor costs, safety regulations and domestic-airline ticket prices.
However, the agency gave final approval last month, saying it found no legal reason to reject Norwegian’s application.
A group of labor unions has also reportedly filed a lawsuit in a federal appeals court, in an attempt to stop the change.
The legal argument about the Obama administration’s decision is that it violates a part of so-called Open Skies agreements that state unrestricted flights among countries are not intended to “undermine labor standards.”

Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said the tweets by Walter Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, were inappropriate and could compromise the agency's objectivity.
In tweets sent in November, Shaub congratulated Trump for agreeing to divest from his business—an agreement Trump had not yet made. Shaub later issued a scathing review of Trump's plan to turn over control of his business to his sons.
Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah called Shaub's Jan. 11 comments ""highly unethical"" and summoned Shaub to a closed-door meeting. Chaffetz and committee Democrats met with Shaub for more than an hour Monday, an unusual meeting prompted by Republicans' frustration with the ethics office and its operations—rather than Trump.
Chaffetz, the chairman of the GOP-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he sent a letter to Walter Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, asking him to appear before lawmakers in a closed-door, transcribed interview.
Politico reported that Shaub responded to the request in a letter asking for their meeting to be open to the public to “ensure transparency and educate the public about how OGE guards the executive branch against conflicts of interest.”
The OGE is responsible for ensuring that members of the new administration are avoiding potential conflicts of interest.
Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the panel's senior Democrat, said lawmakers from both parties were troubled by Shaub's initial ""bravo"" tweets, sent soon after Trump was elected president.

Pai had previously served as a Republican member of the FCC before he was chosen to lead the agency under the next administration.
""This afternoon, I was informed that [President Trump] designated me the 34th chairman of the FCC. It is a deeply humbling honor,"" he tweeted Monday afternoon, adding in a statement that he intends to ""bring the benefits of the digital age to all Americans.""
Before joining the FCC in 2012, Pai served as associate general counsel of Verizon Communications Inc. and as a staffer in the Senate and Justice Department. He and Trump had met at Trump Tower earlier this month.

263,"Making good on a campaign promise, President Trump on Monday signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.
He also signed two other orders -- one placing a hiring freeze on some federal workers and the other reinstating a ban on funding for international groups that perform abortions.
The TPP, a giant and semi-secret 12-member free-trade agreement advocated by the Obama administration, aimed to deepen economic ties between the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim nations, cut taxes and foster trade to boost economic growth in the process.
""We’ve been talking about this for a long time,"" Trump said, as he signed the document. He called the order to pull out of TPP a “great thing for the American worker.”
Trump argued on the campaign trail that the TPP is harmful to U.S. workers and robs the manufacturing sector.
""We're going to have trades but we're going to have one on one...if somebody misbehaves we will send a letter and they'll have 30 days to work it out,"" Trump said.
Supporters of TTP said it would have been a boon for all 12 nations involved and would unlock business opportunities on a global scale. Opponents argued, among other things, it would encourage exporting U.S. jobs to low-wage nations.
Trade has been the rare issue where Trump and labor unions have found common ground.
“With this decision, the president has taken the first step toward fixing 30 years of bad trade policies that have cost working Americans millions of good paying jobs,” Teamsters Union President James Hoffa said in a written statement.
But Trump’s stance on trade has created tension from some within his own party.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the withdrawal a “serious mistake that will have lasting consequences for America’s economy and our strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region.”
McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also said the decision will “forfeit the opportunity to promote American exports, reduce trade barriers, open new markets, and protect American invention and innovation.”
He added that it would “create an opening for China to rewrite the economic rules of the road at the expense of American workers.”
On the campaign trail, Trump also criticized NAFTA -- the North American Free Trade Agreement -- saying the U.S. manufacturing sector had been battered by bad trade deals.
During a meeting Sunday, Trump signaled he would make changes to NAFTA. Signed into law in 1994 by former President Bill Clinton, NAFTA is a trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. It essentially eliminates almost all tariffs between the three nations, allowing the flow of goods and supplies across borders.
One of the other executive orders Trump signed reinstates a ban on federal funds going to international groups that perform abortions or even advocate it as an option.
The ban has been in place since 1984 and has gone back and forth depending on the party in power in the White House.
Pro-life groups praised the decision.
“President Trump is continuing Ronald Reagan’s legacy by taking immediate action on day one to stop the promotion of abortion through our tax dollars overseas,"" Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement.
Former President Obama ended the ban in 2009.
Trump reinstated it one day after the Jan. 22 anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion in the United States.
“With this action, Donald Trump has turned his anti-women rhetoric into policy, and made it more difficult for women and families all over the world to access vital reproductive care,” NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said in the written statement. “He really is living up to the lowest of expectations.”
The new commander-in-chief also signed an executive order on Monday that froze hiring for some federal government employees.
“Except for the military,” he said when signing it.",negative
264,"President Trump is set to kick off his first full ‘work day’ in the White House by signing an executive order withdrawing the United States from a controversial Pacific-nation trade deal, Fox News is told.
The president is expected to sign an order taking the U.S. out of the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement, which he railed against during the campaign and which Hillary Clinton previously supported before distancing herself from the deal.
The executive order, and possibly others, are being signed after a weekend of introductory meetings and perfunctory duties marking the transfer of power.
Trump has said he considers Monday his first real day in the office.
Bracketing the order-signing on Monday are a host of meetings at the White House, including a listening session with business leaders, another one with union leaders and later a reception with congressional leaders from both parties.
He'll also hold his first meeting as president with the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.
""Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security,"" Trump tweeted early Monday. ""Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America.""
In his early-morning meeting with business leaders, Trump said he would impose a ""substantial border tax"" on companies that move their manufacturing out of the United States, while promising unspecified advantages to companies that manufacture domestically.
""All you have to do is stay,"" he said during a morning meeting in the White House's Roosevelt Room.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin were among the executives who attended the meeting.
The busy agenda and focus on policy issues could help the Trump administration reset after a weekend of warring with the media over their reporting on inaugural crowd sizes and other issues. Both Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer excoriated the media on Saturday for allegedly underplaying the turnout – though Spicer went on to make his own questionable claims touting Friday’s attendance, despite available statistics and aerial photography making clear attendance at then-President Obama’s 2009 inauguration was higher.
Trump delivered a more unifying message Sunday and sought to reassure Americans he was up to the daunting task ahead.
Speaking in the White House East Room during a swearing-in ceremony for top aides, the president warned his staff of the challenges ahead, but declared he believed they were ready.
""This is not about party, this is not about ideology. This is about country, our country. It's about serving the American people,"" he said.
Trump also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accepted an invitation to visit the White House in early February. The prime minister said he is hoping to forge a ""common vision"" with the newly inaugurated U.S. president that could include expanded settlement construction and a tougher policy toward Iran.
Trump also announced that he's set up meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.
""We're going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA,"" he said of his meeting with Pena Nieto. Mexico is part of the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada. Trump said he also will discuss immigration and security at the border. He has promised to build a wall along the length of the southern border and insisted that Mexico will pay for it.
His chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" the president would spend his first full week in office undoing some of Obama's agenda and planned to sign executive orders on immigration and trade.

265,"Hulking defensive ends bearing down on him, the NFL investigating his deflated footballs, charming a super model – none of these things rattle New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
Talking about President Donald Trump? That’s a different story.
""Um, I have called him, yes, in the past,” Brady said when asked about his relationship with Trump on WEEI’s “Kirk and Callahan” show on Monday. “Sometimes he calls me. Sometimes I call him. But, again, that's been someone that I've known. I always try to keep it in context because for 16 years you know someone before maybe he was in the position that he was in. He's been very supportive of me for a long time. It's just a friendship. I have a lot of friends. I call a lot of people.""
INTERNET MOCKS BRADY FOR MASSIVE COAT
Ever since a “Make America Great Again” cap was spotted in Brady’s locker near the outset of Trump’s improbable presidential campaign, the media has questioned the quarterback over his ties to Trump. The (once again) Super Bowl-bound Brady has been just as evasive as he would be if he were being chased out of the pocket by a pair of linebackers.
“Why does everybody make such a big deal? I don’t understand it,” an increasingly squeamish Brady told WEEI.
Making matters worse for Brady, he has to balance a fan base – and more importantly a wife – who are not all that friendly toward Trump.
Massachusetts went overwhelmingly to Hillary Clinton on Election Day, 61 percent to 33.5 percent (in Foxborough, where the Patriots play, the margin was a bit slimmer, with Clinton beating Trump 51.3-41.8).
At home, the scales tipped even further in Clinton’s favor.
Asked on Instagram if she and her husband were supporting Trump, Brady’s wife Gisele Bundchen replied with an unequivocal: “NO!”
Trump himself hasn’t made things easy on Brady. The night before the election, Trump told a crowd in New Hampshire that Brady had indeed cast his vote for the billionaire real estate mogul.
“Tom Brady, great guy, great friend of mine, great, great champion, unbelievable winner. He called today,” Trump said. “And he said, ‘Donald, I support you, you’re my friend, I voted for you.’”
Brady allegedly gave Trump the “okay” to re-tell the story. But on Monday, Brady didn’t sound like a man eager to express his support for the 45th president.
""I don't want to get into it, but if you know someone it doesn't mean you agree with everything they say or they do. You have a lot of friends in your life,"" Brady said. ""I think there are things that are based in your own dealings with someone that is a personal dealing, not a public dealing. Because you have personal experiences.""",negative

(Although Madonna's declaration that she's often thought of ""blowing up the White House""--and dropping F-bombs on live TV--received no media pushback.)
But the level of vitriol on social media is out of control. Rather Madonna-like, you might say.
I’ve taken to calling these outbursts a case of Trump Trauma, and they were surging over the inaugural weekend.
I’m not even talking about “SNL” writer Katie Rich, who saw fit to tweet a sick joke about Trump’s son Barron, and then deleted it. Mocking a 10-year-old boy! I won't repeat it here.

Former reporter Larry Portzline: “I'm hoping the Dumbf beats William Henry Harrison's record. And I don't mean for longest inauguration speech.”
Business consultant Jeff De-Cagna:
“What's happening today is not ‘the peaceful transfer of power.’ We have been slow-walking our way into tyranny for 18 months now, and we have finally arrived. Today's events are a bloodless coup with the patina of democratic process.”
So let’s take those last two. Beating William Henry Harrison’s record means catching pneumonia at the inaugural speech and dying.
And yes, Trump’s inaugural was the peaceful transfer of power, he won 306 electoral votes, and this is not “tyranny.” Nor is it a “coup.”
Why do people post such ugly stuff even before the man had spent a full day in office?
And yes, I’m fully aware that people said and posted all kinds of ugly and untrue garbage about Barack Obama, and I spoke out against that too.
I guess on one level it’s venting. On another it’s playing to your crowd, to the friends you assume will agree.

“The United States is committed to a political resolution to the Syrian crisis through a Syrian-owned process, which can bring about a more representative, peaceful, and united Syria,” the State Department said in a statement. “Given our presidential inauguration and the immediate demands of the transition, a delegation from Washington will not be attending the Astana conference.”
Russia has seized on the election of Donald Trump to call for greater cooperation between Moscow and Washington to end the Syrian civil war.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and other senior officials, however, have voiced hope that Mr. Trump will be more cooperative in Syria.

269,"The Senate is expected on Monday to hold its confirmation vote on President Trump’s pick for CIA director, Kansas GOP Rep. Mike Pompeo. But the chamber’s Republican and Democratic leaders this weekend offered sharply different perspectives about the future of the president’s 20-plus Cabinet nominees.
Top Senate Democrats on Friday postponed Pompeo’s vote saying they wouldn’t rush through the confirmation process for Trump and fellow Republicans who control Congress.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that several of Trump’s remaining nominees will be subject to “a thorough debate.”
The New York Democrat said he was “dubious” about eight or nine of Trump's picks -- citing potential conflicts of interests and policy stands.
The Senate has so far confirmed just two Trump nominees: Gens. James Mattis, as defense secretary, and John Kelly, as Homeland Security secretary, on Friday when Trump was sworn-in as president.
However, Senate Democrats have little chance of blocking a confirmation unless some chamber Republicans defect.
Senate Republicans have a 52-to-48 majority and need only a simple majority of 51 to confirm a nominee.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed confidence Sunday about having enough votes to get all of Trump’s nominees confirmed.
“I believe we’ll be able to confirm the president’s entire Cabinet,” the Kentucky Republican told “Fox News Sunday.” “I’m optimistic.”
The prospects for former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson becoming secretary of state improved this weekend when two influential Republican senators expressed support, after having waivered over Tillerson’s past professional ties to Russia.
""Though we still have concerns about his past dealings with the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin, we believe that Mr. Tillerson can be an effective advocate for U.S. interests,"" Sens. John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, said in a joint statement.
Tillerson also faces a vote Monday, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
McCain, Graham and fellow GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida, have questioned whether Tillerson has too many conflicts of interests to champion U.S. policy abroad, especially in Russia.
As CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson spoke out against U.S. sanctions levied on Moscow following its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. The penalties cost the energy giant hundreds of millions of dollars.
The episode became even more of a concern after the U.S. intelligence community concluded Russia meddled in the presidential election to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the White House race.
McCain and Graham are not on the Foreign Relations committee, like Rubio. However all three will cast a final vote on the Tillerson nomination, if he gets enough votes Monday in the committee, which has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats.
Graham told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that he was persuaded to back Tillerson after they met privately. According to Graham, Tillerson told him ""when America doesn't lead, other people will, and the vacuum is always filled by bad actors. He said that we have to have a foreign policy that engages the world. We need to lead from the front.""
McCain said on ABC's ""This Week"" that he talked to Tillerson about his views on Russia and his duty heading a major corporation.
“This wasn't an easy call,"" McCain said. ""But I also believe that, when there's doubt, the president, the incoming president, gets the benefit of the doubt.""
Rubio, who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination last year, clashed with Tillerson at a hearing earlier this month.
Rubio bristled at Tillerson's refusal to label Putin a ""war criminal"" or condemn human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines in strong enough terms. He also chided Tillerson over the need for ""moral clarity.""
Hours after Trump was sworn in on Friday, Rubio was tight-lipped, saying he would make his decision ""certainly before the vote"" Monday and that Tillerson's responses to written questions had addressed ""some of"" his concerns.
Still, a ""no"" vote from Rubio would not doom Tillerson's confirmation, because the nomination could go directly to the Senate floor even without a positive committee recommendation. But it would be an embarrassing rebuke to Trump just as his presidency gets under way, with questions swirling about his ties to Russia.

270,"President Trump said Sunday that he’ll discuss immigration and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement when he meets soon with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, part of a busy fourth day for his administration.
“Anybody ever hear of NAFTA,” Trump said during a White House swearing-in of several top administration officials including senior adviser Kellyanne Conway. “I ran a campaign somewhat based on NAFTA, on immigration and security at the border. And Mexico has been terrific.”
The president will meet on Jan. 31 with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, according to the White House.
To be sure, Trump ran for office on a pledge to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and have Mexico pay for it. And he reiterated that promise following the election.
The president is also expected to meet soon with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country is also a partner in NAFTA.
Trump has blamed the three-nation trade pact for disadvantaging American workers and leading companies to move out of the United States.
Earlier in the day, White House officials said that they are having preliminary discussions about plans to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and, separately, that President Trump will not release his tax returns.
The statement about officials being at the “very beginning” of discussions on possibly moving the embassy follows reports in Israeli media that Trump had imminent plans to announce the move.
Trump, who has said he would move the embassy to Jerusalem, spoke Sunday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by telephone.
Previous presidential candidates also have promised to make the embassy move. But presidents have avoided following through on that pledge in part because of concerns that it would inflame tensions in the Middle East.
In addition, Conway said Sunday that Trump won’t release his tax returns, appearing to shut the door on a decades-long tradition of transparency.
Every president since 1976 has released their returns. During the campaign, Trump refused to make his filings public, saying they were under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and saying he'd release them after that review is complete.
Conway was asked Sunday about a petition on the White House website signed by more than 200,000 people calling for Trump to release his returns.
""The White House response is that he's not going to release his tax returns,"" she said on ABC’s “This Week.” ""We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care.""

The Secret Service declined to comment Sunday about reports the agency plans to investigate the comment as a threat.

“I think we’re going to work with the House and Senate leadership, as well as to get a long-term solution on that issue,” Priebus told “Fox News Sunday.” “I'm not going to make any commitments to you, but … I'm obviously foreshadowed there a little bit.”
Immigration advocates had warned since essentially the start of the 2016 presidential race that Trump, if elected, would crack down on illegal immigration.
To be sure, Trump won the race on a platform that included vows to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep out illegal immigrants.
But many already in the country and others have expressed greater concerns about Trump undoing President Obama's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive action that defers deportation for an estimated 700,000 illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents -- and known as ""dreamers.""
Those concerns recently surfaced during retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly’s confirmation hearing on become Homeland Security secretary when California Sen. Kamal Harris pressed him on whether Trump would roll back DACA.
“I don’t know what the incoming administration is doing with that,” Kelly responded. “But I promise you, I will be involved in the process.”

Trump suggested to CIA staffers Saturday on his visit to the agency that his well-publicized rift with the U.S. intelligence community was drummed up by the media.
Trump didn’t agree with some in the intelligence community’s who concluded that Russia influenced the 2016 White House race to help him win.
And he argued more recently that somebody within that community leaking an unofficial dossier with alleged damaging personal information about him was like living in “Nazi Germany.”
Priebus told Fox that “one bad actor” likely leaked the document so Trump wasn’t angry at all of the country’s intelligence officers.
“I’m telling you; It was a love fest in there,” Priebus said about Trump’s visit at CIA headquarters that was attended by about 300 staffers.
He also suggested that a reporter was at best careless in erroneously reporting that Trump has removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office.
“It could have had explosive ramifications. … It was shoot first, point later,” he said about the inaccurate report, for which the reporter later apologized.
Priebus also defended Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s comments Saturday about the news media underreporting the crowd size at Trump’s swearing-in Friday.
At a hastily called White House press conference, Spicer angrily accused the media of “false reporting” on the inauguration as part of what he called a “shameful” attempt to minimize enthusiasm for Trump. He then left without taking questions.
Priebus said Sunday: “The point is not the crowd. The point is the media is trying to delegitimize the presidency.""",negative

“You are special people, you are great, great people,” Trump said. “I have your back.”
Speaking about the hard-fought campaign, Trump said: “I did a good job as a messenger. But I am your messenger, just remember that.”

“We’ve been pushed around by a lot of different people, lots of bad things are happening,” Trump said. “But I think you’re going to see a big improvement, really.”

First Lady Melania Trump also spoke for the only time on Friday evening, thanking the troops for their service and saying she was “honored” to be First Lady. She ended with a line that dovetailed perfectly with her husband’s fiery rhetoric.
“We will fight. We will win. And we will make America great again,” she said.
At the earlier Freedom Ball, Trump’s biggest crowd pleaser was a voice poll on whether he should keep tweeting now that he’s president. Those in attendance roared with approval.

279,"The President possesses the bully pulpit.
Political analysts have penned entire dissertations about how an effective president serves as the chief whip in Congress. He makes calls behind the scenes and huddles with key lawmakers to spur movement on key legislative initiatives.
And new to the enterprise is how President Trump disciplined the country in the power of governing via Twitter.
What do lawmakers think about Trump’s medium of choice?
“I don’t want to give the president (sic) advice,” Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, recently said. “I don’t want to be a tweet-ee.”
And therein lies the threat -- if it can be called that.
Will lawmakers tremble when Trump threatens to call them out publicly should they not back one of his legislative priorities or support a cabinet or judicial appointment?
The question centers on how much deference lawmakers will grant the president during his first days in office.
Trump enters as one of the most-unpopular presidents in four decades. He lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly 3million votes and failed to even crack 46 percent of the popular vote.
Twenty House Republicans represent districts Clinton carried.
Many congressional Republicans who ultimately supported Trump did so tepidly. Scores climbed on board after he vanquished Clinton. It was not much of a clarion endorsement. Rather, after eight years of President Obama, Republicans in Congress were buoyed by the opportunity of unified government.
With President Trump in the White House, Republicans have the opportunity to detonate ObamaCare, reverse the financial law known as Dodd-Frank and fillet a host of executive orders with which conservatives disagree. The GOP has a willing partner in the White House to perhaps drill deeply into revising the tax code for the first time in more than three decades.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow, called out Trump on multiple occasions -- even disinviting the GOP nominee from a rally in his home-state of Wisconsin after the appearance of the lewd Access Hollywood tape. But now the speaker stands behind the president foursquare.
A marriage of convenience for politics sake or is this a governing “coalition?” Unclear. But consider the tone of Ryan’s words directed at Trump during the campaign, to say nothing of what the president said then about the speaker.
But with these men now holding two of the three Constitutional offices of U.S. government, Ryan would find himself in a nearly untenable position were he to get crossways with the president now.
That could come. But for now, Ryan and most other Republicans, are on the train.
The reasons? Trump enjoyed a moderate Electoral College victory. There was no popular vote mandate. Unsteady support from congressional Republicans. Plus, the entire House and one-third of the Senate faces re-election in two years (only eight of the those seats are held by Republicans.
Experts would argue that only two of those are possibly in play). Still, the potential toxicity of a president often filters down-ballot to members of his own party. Look at the Democrats in 1994 and 2010. Check out the Republicans in 2006.
So how high will congressional Republicans jump when President-elect Trump orders them to jump?
So far, the GOP has hops.
Consider what happened in the hours just before the Congress started on January 3. Rank-and-file House Republicans ignored the advice of Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and decided instead to defang the quasi-official Capitol Hill watchdog known as the Office of Congressional Ethics.
The OCE isn’t popular among lawmakers of either party. The office allows outside persons or groups to file ethics complaints against lawmakers -- which are sometimes unfounded and specious. But it’s bad optics for Congress to enfeeble an ethics steward and undercut potential whistleblowers.
The 115th Congress was due to convene at noon that day. Voting on the new ethics plan would be part of the House’s “rules package” and constitute one of the first votes of the year.
But that morning, Trump unleashed a Tweet storm, hectoring members of his own party.
“With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it ... may be, their number one act and priority? Focus on tax reform, health care and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS.”
At a press briefing that morning, McCarthy told reporters there wasn’t a plan to revise the rules package despite a barrage of negative press overnight. But Mr. Trump’s badgering seemed to turn the tide. Granted, some lawmakers re-thought the proposal and backed off on their own.
But at 11:50 that morning, a mere ten minutes before the start of the Congress, the GOP yanked the ethics overhaul language from the rules plan.
It was done -- all via the Twitter pulpit.
A few days ago, the president proclaimed, “We’re going to have insurance for everybody.”
Such a pronouncement sent ripples through Capitol Hill, as Republicans scramble to concoct a replacement bill for ObamaCare. The president was careful to mention he didn’t envision “single-payer.” That’s a program in which the government operates the health system.
Some Republicans rushed to spin Trump’s line about “universal coverage.” But still, insuring more people is a goal of most policymakers, regardless of party.
“I think it’s a noble aspiration,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas.
“The president speaks conceptually,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who’s crafting a replacement bill. “He believes they can drive down insurance premiums by insuring more people.”
It’s unclear whether this was just a line from the president, a goal or a command to Congress. And nobody is quite sure how this fits into that still-nebulous ObamaCare replacement bill, floating in the congressional ether.
“I understand they’re working on a plan and we’re eager to see it,” Cornyn said.
And then there is a potential jam on tax reform.
Trump fired a shot across the bow of the GOP proposal to craft a “border adjustable” tax for international business.
Congressional insiders argue that the adjustable border tax could produce $1 trillion in revenue by taxing imports and not exports.
The border adjustable tax provision is essential to Republican tax reform proposals because it would hypothetically fill the federal coffers.
That would fill fiscal vacuums created by the repeal of ObamaCare and offset major new spending on the military and infrastructure. But the president squelched the tax idea as too complex.
“I don’t love the plan,” said he told The Wall Street Journal.
Congressional Republicans argue there’s still a way to work out the tax provisions. But thwarting the idea sent congressional Republicans scurrying for new ideas.
Of course, this sort of comment by a president arguing that he isn’t in favor of one proposal or another isn’t new. Presidents do that all the time to persuade and cajole members to do something else -- and threaten to veto and actually veto bills. But it’s unknown what powers of persuasion this President brings to the office.
The office. The Oval Office.
Trump certainly exercises his social media bona fides, unleashing blistering attacks on Twitter. But when you become president, the muscles augment with the power of the position.
There is no room in the Western World more intimidating than the Oval Office. It’s symbolizes the president’s broad capacities. And when members of Congress are summoned to the Oval Office for a tête-à-tête, a shiver sometimes ripples up their spine.
The most-powerful congressional committee chairman, senior senators and blustery lawmakers cower when beckoned for an audience with the president of the United States in the Oval Office.
Compare that to Twitter?
The president sent his first Tweet from the official @POTUS account Friday afternoon, saying “On behalf of my entire family, THANK YOU!”
But just moments after Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office, the @POTUS Twitter account flipped to President Trump.
“@POTUS hasn’t tweeted yet,” read the notice at the time.

280,"The Interior Department was told to temporarily “shut down” its official Twitter accounts after the National Park Service shared two tweets during the inauguration that were unflattering to President Trump.
The Washington Post reported late Friday that one retweet suggested Trump drew a smaller crowd to his inauguration than ex-president Barack Obama did in 2009, while the other noted several omissions of policy areas on the new White House website.
Looks like the Trump administration hasn't taken control of the @NatlParkService Twitter feed just yet. pic.twitter.com/dCKGHoW0cU — Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) January 20, 2017
Park Service staffers posted the retweets during the inauguration Friday, according to the Post.
A check of the Park Service Twitter account Saturday morning found that both retweets had been removed.
“All bureaus and the department have been directed by incoming administration to shut down Twitter platforms immediately until further notice,” Park Service employees were told Friday afternoon in an email obtained by the Post.
The email called the stand-down an “urgent directive” and said social media managers must shut down the accounts “until further directed,” according to the paper.
An Interior Department statement on Saturday said the Twitter accounts have since resumed activity after social media guidance was ""clarified."" The statement said the retweets were ""inconsistent with the agency's approach to engaging the public through social media,"" and the suspension was done ""out of an abundance of caution.""
The department has dozens of official Twitter accounts at its multiple offices and 10 bureaus, which include the Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Geological Survey, the paper reported.
The crowd comparison tweet that the Park Service shared came from a New York Times reporter.
One Park Service account informed its Twitter followers of the shut down Saturday night.
“Until further notice, all park road condition updates will provided on the Mount Rainier Facebook page, the MountRainierNPService said in a tweet.

A Park Service spokesman told the Post that the retweet violated an agency policy that prohibits estimating the size of crowds at events, because they are often inaccurate.",positive
281,"President Trump began his first full day in the White House by attending the traditional, post-inauguration National Prayer Service on Saturday before visiting the CIA.
The roughly one-hour, interfaith service at the Washington National Cathedral included the National Anthem and a Muslim prayer.
“Hold fast that which is good,” said Bishop Mariann Budde, of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. “Make no peace with oppression. Strengthen the weak. … Honor all people.""
Trump has wasted no time tackling official business -- signing an executive order just hours after being sworn in Friday to ease ObamaCare provisions.
Though a trip to the CIA might seem to come particularly early, a visit to the country’s top spy agency is of particular interest for Trump, considering the tensions between him and the intelligence community following findings about Russia interfering in the 2016 presidential race, at times allegedly to help his candidacy.
Trump last week suggested that intelligence officials leaked an unofficial dossier on him containing embarrassing and highly suspect allegations, and compared the situation to living in “Nazi Germany.”
Outgoing CIA Director John Brennan has denied accusations that he leaked the document and suggested last week to Fox News that Trump lacks “a full understanding of Russian capabilities and the actions they are taking on the world.”
Trump will arrive at the CIA without an agency director.
He appointed Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo, a fellow Republican, to be the new chief, but Senate Democrats on Friday delayed Pompeo’s confirmation.
The CIA executive director, Meroe Park, is temporarily in charge.
Trump’s and Vice President Mike Pence's visit to the Episcopal cathedral -- which over roughly the past 50 years has hosted President Reagan’s funeral and dozens of other official-Washington events -- also comes with controversy.
Some in the church’s largely liberal congregation have objected to hosting this year’s prayer service.
Budde recently wrote in blog post that she shares ""a sense of outrage at some of the (Trump’s) words and actions"" but feels an obligation to welcome all people without qualification.
The Saturday service, also attended by the first family and the vice president's family, also included a Navaho Nation blessing and a Jewish prayer.
Also on Friday, Pence administered the oath of office to Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the first members of Trump's Cabinet to clear Senate confirmation.
Asked about his first day as president, Trump said, ""It was busy but good -- a beautiful day.""
He also signed a proclamation declaring a national day of patriotism, according to a tweet from White House spokesman Sean Spicer.
Though Trump campaigned on a detailed 18-point plan of things to do on Day One, he backed off some of his promised speed, downplaying the importance of a rapid-fire approach to complex issues that may involve negotiations with Congress or foreign leaders. Trump has said that he expects Monday to be the first big workday, his effective Day One.
There are others signs that Trump’s new government is up and running.
Federal websites and agencies immediately began reflecting the transfer of power, and WhiteHouse.gov was revamped for Trump's policy priorities as pages about LGBT rights and the Obama administration's climate change plan were eliminated.
Shortly after Trump became president, the Department of Housing and Urban Development suspended the Obama administration's planned reduction of mortgage insurance premium rates, a move that had been intended to make buying a home more affordable.
More significant policy announcements are expected in the early days of the Trump administration.
Trump's spokesman has said the president intends to withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, which he views as detrimental to U.S. businesses and workers. He has also promised to renegotiate the two-decades-old Clinton era North American Free Trade Agreement or withdraw from it.

282,"President Trump used his first executive order late Friday to immediately undercut his predecessor’s signature health care law, ordering federal agencies to ease the “regulatory burdens” of ObamaCare -- a move that could be aimed at rolling back the law’s so-called individual mandate.
The requirement to buy insurance is one of the more unpopular components of the law. Trump’s order stated clearly that his policy is to seek the “prompt repeal” of the Affordable Care Act, but also said his directive to agencies in the meantime is meant to minimize the economic impact of the law.
The order stated that relevant agency heads “shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.”
The language does not specifically cite the individual mandate -- which was at the center of the Supreme Court battle under the Obama administration that ultimately left the law in place -- but was seen as a potential swipe at that provision, among others.
""It's a sign that the Trump administration is looking to unwind the law in every way it can administratively,"" said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for information and analysis about the health care system.
One distinct possibility is for the government to find new ways to grant exemptions from the law's requirement that people who remain uninsured pay fines, if deemed able to afford coverage. For example, GOP lawmakers in Congress have proposed an exemption for people in areas where only one insurer offers coverage -- currently about a third of U.S. counties.
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Saturday that the order indeed “appears to target the individual mandate.”
The California Democrat, a staunch supporter of the law, warned: “When President Trump threatens the individual mandate, he threatens the affordable health coverage of the millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions.”
It may take weeks or months to discern the full impact of Trump's directive. Departments like Health and Human Services and Treasury will have to issue policies that embody the new president's wishes.
The executive order may not have much impact for 2017, since government rules for this year have already been incorporated into contracts signed with insurance companies.
Leslie Dach, campaign director of the Protect Our Care Coalition, issued a statement saying, ""While President Trump may have promised a smooth transition, the Executive Order does the opposite, threatening disruption for health providers and patients."" He called the executive order ""irresponsible.""
Trump made clear he is not unilaterally suspending the Affordable Care Act. It remains on the books, and his directive instructs agencies to act within ""the maximum extent permitted by law.""
Changing the underlying law would require Congress to act, but the Trump administration can rewrite regulations carrying out the legislation. New regulations cannot be issued overnight, but would have to follow a legally established process that requires public notice and an opportunity for interested parties to comment on the administration's changes.
Trump's order also directed agency heads to ""encourage the development of a free and open market in interstate commerce for the offering of healthcare services and health insurance,"" a key component of Republicans' ObamaCare replacement plan.
Simultaneously, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus directed agencies Friday not to submit any new regulations to be published in the Federal Register unless a Trump-selected agency head approves it. The memo is similar to one that Obama's chief of staff issued the day Obama was inaugurated in 2009.
Most of Trump's first substantive acts as president will wait until Monday, his first full work day at the White House.

Reporters first noticed that the bust had been placed back in the room on Friday, just as Trump was signing a series of executive orders at the Resolute desk.
Obama had moved the bust to the White House residence during his first few days in office and later installed separate busts of Martin Luther King Jr. and President Lincoln in its place.
A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed last week that Trump had personally asked if England would loan the bust of Churchill to the U.S. once he took office.

284,"President Trump on Friday was forced to hand over his beloved Android cellphone in favor of a new encrypted phone he will use during his term in office, The New York Times reported.
The Times called Trump's Android his “Linus blanket” that held hundreds of contacts. The report said that security officials have also asked Trump to stop using the Twitter handle @RealDonaldTrump and to use @POTUS.
Trump recently told a friend that he had given up his phone, as security agencies had urged him to do. It was unclear whether he was following the lead of President Obama, the nation's first cellphone-toting president, who exchanged his personal device for a Blackberry heavily modified for security purposes.
The presidency has long been a lonely, isolating office, with security concerns keeping the commander in chief at a distance from the public.
LIVE BLOG: TRUMP SAYS TO KEEP FIGHTING, WE'RE GOING TO WIN
Under Obama, worries about cyber intrusions — particularly by foreign governments — pulled the president's technology deeper into the security bubble as well. Many of the functions on Obama's Blackberry were blocked and only a handful of people had his phone number or email address.
Trump doesn't email, but he uses his phone to tweet — something he's made clear he plans to continue in office. He's known to make calls early in the morning and late at night, often seeking input from multiple sources when making a decision. Sometimes he leaves a voicemail.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., called Trump ""amazingly accessible,"" saying the president-elect picks up his phone even when he doesn't know who is calling.
""My phone says, No Caller ID, so I'm not saying that it has anything to do with me,"" Corker said. ""Nobody knows who it is that's calling when I'm calling.""
For Obama, getting to use a Blackberry in office was considered a victory. He later switched to an iPhone that allowed him to send and receive email from a limited group of people, surf websites and read the news.
But Obama wasn't known to use his cellphone to make or receive telephone calls, according to individuals familiar with his technology use. Even senior government officials didn't have the number and instead reached the president through the White House switchboard.
The president also used the switchboard to place his calls, said the individuals, who weren't authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.
Obama had a phone in his control that he used to tweet, one of the only devices with access to the official presidential Twitter feed due to hacking concerns. But Obama rarely hit ""send"" on a tweet himself, and never without coordinating it with his staff, the individuals said.
A reporter for the Associated Press wrote about Trump’s accessibility.
A few hours after Trump was briefed by intelligence officials about Russian meddling in the election, an Associated Press reporter called his cellphone seeking an interview.
The call went to voicemail and the reporter did not leave a message. About an hour later, Trump called back.
It's hard to imagine many politicians — particularly one about to become president of the United States — calling back an unknown number on their cellphone.

285,"President Trump visited the CIA on Saturday in a conciliatory bid to end a feud with the intelligence community -- a dispute he suggested was overblown by the media -- while making clear one of his top priorities will be to destroy Islamic State terror groups.
“We have to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. Radical Islamic terrorism, it has to be eradicated,” said Trump, on his first full day in the White House and his first official agency stop of his presidency.
Trump's decision to travel to CIA headquarters so quickly after taking office was seen as an attempt at a fresh start with the intelligence agencies he will now rely on for guidance as he makes weighty national security decisions. Following his private meeting with top CIA leaders, Trump said the U.S. had been ""restrained"" in its efforts to combat terrorism, calling the threat ""a level of evil we haven't seen.""
Trump’s trip across the Potomac River to the agency’s headquarters in northern Virginia follows a tumultuous past couple of months in which the U.S. intelligence community has suggested Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 campaign was meant to help Trump beat the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The CIA, FBI and other agencies in the so-called U.S. intelligence community recently issued a report that stated Putin and Russia meddled in the race, though it found no evidence of vote tampering.
However, Trump last week suggested outgoing CIA Director John Brennan may have leaked an unofficial dossier on him containing embarrassing and highly suspect allegations, and compared the situation to living in “Nazi Germany.”
John Brennan has denied such accusations and said Trump lacks “a full understanding” of Russian capabilities and the actions the country is taking in the world.
“Nobody feels stronger about the intelligence community than Donald Trump,” the president said Saturday. “I love you. I respect you. There’s nobody whom I respect more. We are going to start winning again.""
Trump suggested that the news media, which he has repeatedly argued are dishonest and have treated him unfairly, overplayed his concerns about intelligence officials. He also accused the media of mischaracterizing the size of his inauguration crowds.
California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, slammed Trump for using his CIA visit to squabble over media coverage.
""He will need to do more than use the agency memorial as a backdrop if he wants to earn the respect of the men and women who provide the best intelligence in the world,' Schiff said.
Former CIA Director John Brennan went further. His former aide Nick Shapiro released a statement saying ""Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself.""
“We are going to do great things,” said Trump, who also tried to reassure the roughly 400 agency employees who assembled at the headquarters that his pick to run the agency now, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo, would advance the CIA and its mission as the country’s top spy agency.
Before joining Congress, Pompeo was first in his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served in the Army and graduated from Harvard Law School.
“Everything he’s done is a home run,” Trump said. “People like him. People respect him. You are going to be getting a total star.""
Trump said during his winning campaign that President Obama didn’t do enough to destroy ISIS, the upstart terror group that emerged in the chaos of the Middle East and has since claimed responsibility for dozens of terror attacks over the past several years that have killed hundreds.
Trump had begun his first full day in the White House by attending the traditional, post-inauguration National Prayer Service.

She described her look as ""Trump revolutionary wear."" Social media users had a field day, the most polite comparison being to the uniform costumes in ""The Nutcracker"" ballet. Conway's coat retails for $3,600.
Mrs. Trump's look, with its bolero-style jacket, prompted comparisons to a fashion icon of the past, Jacqueline Kennedy, who wore an outfit by Oleg Cassini with a matching pillbox hat to husband John F. Kennedy's 1961 inauguration.
""I think she looked sensational,"" New York fashion expert Hal Rubenstein said of the new first lady's style. ""She's not a huge risk-taker, but she dresses in that smart, sophisticated Upper East Side urban style.""
On Thursday, when inauguration events kicked off, Mrs. Trump shimmered in gold for the Candlelight Dinner in a long-sleeve beaded gown by Reem Acra. Ivanka Trump wore a white cap-sleeve de la Renta gown with a large black bow at the back.
For the wreath-laying ceremony earlier that day at Arlington National Cemetery, Mrs. Trump picked a black military-style coat by the New York-based designer Norisol Ferrari. Ivanka Trump provided Thursday's pop of color in kelly green de la Renta.
Will Melania Trump continue to be inspired, fashion-wise, by the late Mrs. Onassis? Will she embrace young design talent and the fashion world as wholeheartedly as Mrs. Obama?
The new first lady is under no obligation to be inspired at all by those who came before, Rubenstein said. One thing's for sure, he added:
""She knows her clothes, but that's her wardrobe. There's a difference between a wardrobe and a mission and I think right now she hasn't shown that card, and she may not.""",negative
289,"Several hundred thousand people from across the country descended on Washington Saturday to protest Donald Trump just hours into his presidency, donning bright pink hats and carrying a dizzying array of political signs – in a celebrity-studded march that put the nation’s lingering divisions on full display despite the 45th president’s appeal a day earlier for unity.
The protesters, most of whom were women, were largely peaceful by comparison with the scattered bands of rioters who wreaked havoc on parts of D.C. during Friday’s inauguration. This crowd was far larger and more organized.
But the march grew more chaotic as the day went on and protesters moved from the National Mall into the streets. And despite indications from some organizers last week that the demonstration was not defined as “anti-Trump,” it was in every respect a march against the new president -- kicking off as he attended a National Prayer Service after waking up in the White House for the first time.
“A platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday,” actress America Ferrera told the crowd Saturday morning on the National Mall. “But the president is not America. We are America.”
Other celebrities including Madonna and Michael Moore stirred up the crowd, with Madonna making perhaps the most inflammatory comments. In profanity-laced remarks, the singer said she had “thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House” but knows “this won’t change anything.”
While called the Women's March on Washington, the protest attracted families of men, women and children mostly sporting pro-women and anti-Trump messages. Hundreds of “sister marches” were held in other cities across the U.S. and internationally.
“Of course this is an anti-Trump march,” a local ambassador for the D.C. march, who declined to give his name, said as he directed the crowds toward the rally. “Sure, of course it’s for rights, but it’s really against Trump.”
Another protester called Trump a “terrible president,” though he has only had the keys to the Oval Office for one day.
SLIDESHOW: WOMEN'S MARCH ON WASHINGTON
In his inaugural address Friday, Trump spoke in stark terms about America's problems but also called for a ""new national pride"" to heal divisions. Saturday's march showed protesters united -- only in opposition to the new president, on the grounds where just 24 hours earlier, Trump supporters cheered their candidate’s ascension to power.
Women wearing “pussy-hats” -- hand-knit pointy-eared pink winter headgear -- held posters with derogatory messages and phrases bashing the president and filled the National Mall.
Officials estimated a crowd of 500,000 people, which is more than double what march organizers had predicted. One D.C. official told the Associated Press that the massive turnout also forced organizers to revise plans to march on the White House, and instead head to the nearby ellipse.
Children at times held political messages alongside their parents. One family pushed their toddler son through the crowds in a stroller, wearing a sign that read “Who will have a bigger tantrum? Trump or me?”
The signs touched on a range of other issues, including statements against controversial oil pipelines, drone warfare, voter ID laws and more.
The march, while mostly peaceful, did see isolated incidents, with some women vandalizing portable restrooms designated for the inauguration ceremonies by bashing the locks off with bricks, and some screaming in the faces of a group of people holding signs with Christian messages.
“We’re not here against Trump, but we’re not here for him either,” one of the sign-holders said. “We just want to share that God demonstrated his love towards everyone, regardless of what you believe in.”
March organizers also had uninvited the group “New Wave Feminists,” which initially co-sponsored the event, after finding out that the group held a pro-life stance.
“It’s a very specific type of diversity, which does not include everyone,” Founder and President of New Wave Feminists Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa said on “Fox & Friends” Saturday morning. She said despite the lack of invitation, her group still planned to march. “Any time women come together, exciting things happen – so we definitely wanted to be there with the pro-life contingent.”
The movement spread far beyond Washington, as more than 600 “sister marches” were planned spanning as far abroad as Myanmar and Australia. In Prague, hundreds gathered in freezing weather; in Copenhagen and Sydney, thousands marched.
The D.C. march attracted celebrity participants who took a lead role in pumping up the crowd -- like Ashley Judd, who spoke at a morning rally, and Ferrera, who led the artist contingent scheduling appearances and performances from singers Cher and Katy Perry, comedian Amy Schumer, and actresses Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Debra Messing and Patricia Arquette.
A day after the inaugural ceremonies, though, Trump supporters were still in town and keeping a presence. Overlooking the National Mall on Saturday were members of the pro-Trump group Bikers for Trump.
“I admire a group of like-minded people coming together to march and to demonstrate,” founder Chris Cox said. “But there are a lot of children out there and a lot of the signs are certainly inappropriate – I think maybe they should be a little more sensitive to some of their members.”
Cox said his group, whose message is to support Trump’s agenda regarding Islamic extremism, support for veterans, and illegal immigration, had several speakers scheduled, but was running late due to the congestion from the Women’s March. The list included bishops and two women whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.
Cox condemned the violence that broke out a day earlier.
“They say one thing, and preach and act on another and we don’t condone violence,” Cox told said of his group. “We’re the blue-collar, working guy, and we have a lot to lose – we’re not looking for a fight, but hey, we’re not ones to back down from one either.”

291,"President Trump is set to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May at the White House next week, in his first sit-down with a foreign leader since taking office.
A senior White House official confirmed the meeting to Fox News.
Additional details were not available.
Trump was inaugurated Friday as the 45th president. His first actions as president included installing two Cabinet secretaries and issuing an executive order directing agencies to ease the regulatory burden from ObamaCare.",neutral
292,"The moment Donald Trump swears the oath of office and lifts his hand from the Bible as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, the clock begins on his first 100 days.
And within hours, the man who campaigned as an outsider vowing to shake up Washington will have his chance to start rolling back his predecessor's legacy while forging his own.
The president-elect is set to take the oath shortly before noon, after spending Thursday meeting with supporters and getting his team in place. He met Friday morning with the Obamas. Incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer would not give specific details about the extent and timing of Trump's promised actions to turn back some of President Obama's policies -- but he promised a ""robust"" start.
""Make no mistake, we’re ready to go on Day One,"" he said Thursday. Spicer said earlier that Trump has a ""few"" executive actions, ""probably in the area of four to five, that we're looking at on Friday.""
From there, Trump will be under pressure to begin working on his 100 days bucket list, which he detailed in a speech delivered in Gettysburg, Pa., last October.
Trump's ""Contract with the American Voter"" outlines his plans for the “kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime” -- including 18 major action items. Based on that contract, here's some of the more significant changes the 45th president could have in store for America:
Health Care
Trump wants to ""fully"" repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it -- with what, is not yet entirely clear. His campaign plan called for using ""Health Savings Accounts,"" and allowing insurance to be bought across state lines. Trump says he's still working out the details and will soon have a new proposal, which based on recent interviews also could include taking on the pharmaceutical industry.
Immigration
Trump has vowed to cancel ""all federal funding"" for so-called sanctuary cities as he moves to toughen immigration enforcement. He's vowed to ""begin removing"" the ""criminal illegal immigrants"" from the country at the start of his term, and to suspend immigration from ""terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.""
Trump also promised to work with Congress to introduce a so-called ""End Illegal Immigration Act,"" which would seek a range of changes including setting a two-year minimum federal prison sentence for illegaly re-entering the country after a prior deportation. The legislation, according to his campaign document, also would ""fully"" fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall, with the understanding that Mexico would reimburse the money -- something Mexican politicians say they won't do.
Trump also could move to turn back some of Obama's executive actions that gave a deportation reprieve to some illegal immigrants.
Government Reform
Trump has vowed a set of ethics measures as part of his ""drain the swamp"" mantra.
While Democrats have accused Trump of not living up to that pledge given the connections of some of his Cabinet nominees, he set ambitious targets during the campaign. This included a constitutional amendment to set term limits on members of Congress; a hiring freeze on federal employees; a requirement that any new regulation be offset by the elimination of two existing regulations; a five-year ban on White House officials becoming lobbyists after leaving government; and a permanent ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.
American Workers
Trump talked tough on trade even before he was a candidate, and is vowing to turn those words into action in the White House.
He has said he'd direct his Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator; remove restrictions on American energy production; allow projects like the Keystone pipeline to move forward; and direct certain U.N. funding toward American infrastructure projects.
Trump also said he'd work with Congress on legislation meant to grow the economy 4 percent per year and create at least 25 million jobs. The package would include tax reforms, trade reforms and regulatory relief, as well as help for the energy industry. On taxes, his campaign vowed to cut the number of tax brackets from seven to three and lower the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent.
Further Trump says he'd establish tariffs to discourage companies from offshoring.
Expectations
Trump would hardly be alone in turning back some of his predecessor's policies.
According to the website FiveThirtyEight, Obama signed 19 new executive orders and reversed nine of the orders signed by President George W. Bush in his first 100 days. Eight years earlier, Bush signed 11 new executive orders and revoked 4 Clinton-era actions.
The 100-day benchmark dates back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came into office in 1933 and unleashed a flurry of activity. Over the course of 105 days, Congress passed 76 bills – far exceeding current trends.
By contrast, statistics compiled by Govtrack show just seven bills were passed during George W. Bush’s first 100 days in 2001, and 11 in Obama’s in 2009.
“I am not sure it is as relevant as it once was in this age of new media and increased partisanship. The historical comparison to FDR is not a good gauge since he came into office at a time of national crisis with Democratic control of Congress and a mandate to act,” said Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, agrees that the measure is out of step with current legislative and political realities.
“The whole idea of 100-day agenda is fundamentally at odds with the political reality of 2017 and actually has the potential to undermine the presidency if [Trump] chooses to run roughshod over the Congress,” he told FoxNews.com.
The 100 days may not be important in historical terms, but it is important in setting a tone.
“While Trump needs to get off to a clean start and take quick, decisive action, I think he would be well-advised to break his agenda into three parts – a hundred hours, weeks and months,” said Bill Whalen, a research fellow with the Hoover Institution.
In the meantime, Whalen suggests the new administration address the issues most important to his base – repealing ObamaCare and the Supreme Court.
A Politico/Harvard University poll found Trump voters rank ObamaCare as their top priority. However, it is only the second priority for the general public.
Several political and policy obstacles lie in the administration’s path starting with the confirmation of Rep. Tom Price as secretary of Health and Human Services, noted Paul Howard, director of health policy at the Manhattan Institute.
“The good thing is that the last administration has left behind a lot of administrative flexibility to lay the groundwork for repealing ObamaCare, but it is crucial they get Price confirmed and get some victories behind him,” he said.
According to Howard, if the intention is to simultaneously repeal and replace the law, Trump will need to cut some deals with moderate Democrats to avoid the mistake Obama made in passing it.
The self-professed dealmaker also promised action on jobs by either withdrawing from or renegotiating NAFTA and withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Both efforts may set up an early battle with the pro-free trade GOP leadership in Congress.
“The president has wide latitude to act on trade issues, so one of the significant early questions will be how willing Congress will be to accept his authority on trade,” Grumet said.",negative
293,"Protesters created havoc across Washington on Inauguration Day, shattering glass storefronts and torching cars but never posing a serious security threat to President Trump’s official inaugural ceremonies.
Authorities said 217 people were arrested Friday in the protests and demonstrations, which started before dawn and at one point turned into a full-scale riot.
Most of the damage was inflicted by protesters associated with the group DistruptJ20 that had vowed for weeks to “paralyze” the city.
Black-clad protestors with their faces covered smashed out the windows of a limousine, then set it afire. They also shattered the class-fronts of a Bank of America, McDonald’s and Starbucks, as police officers fired pepper spray to tried to disperse the crowd as it moved from midtown to the Inaugural Parade route on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Metropolitan Police Department Chief Peter Newsham said the destruction started at about 10:30 a.m. and that those arrested were charged with rioting.
He also said that six police officers were injured in clashes with protesters, including three with head injuries. One civilian also was injured, and none of the injuries was life threatening.
“Going into today, the goal was to ensure everyone wishing to peacefully exercise their rights had ability do so,” said Newsham, who also thanked the federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies from across the country that came to help. ”Unfortunately, a small group of people have engaged in vandalism and violence against officers. This will not be tolerated.”
Newsham also called for calm overnight, as visitors attend inauguration balls throughout the city.
The disruptions started early. Shortly after daybreak, protesters started blocking the roughly 10 security checkpoints to the parade and other official events. But Trump’s swearing-in on Capitol Hill and the parade to the White House occurred with no reported problems.
The group Black Lives Matter forced the Secret Service to close one checkpoint after members, just after dawn, started blocked the gates and chaining themselves to fences.
A Kansas couple told FoxNews.com that demonstrators attacked them at the checkpoint.
Celeste Sollars, who said she and her husband came to town from Kansas to see the inauguration, said they were spit on and her husband was put in a chokehold by protesters.
""The cops wouldn't do anything,” she said, crying. “This is not how it was supposed to be -- assault is not a First Amendment right.”
Sollars said she was attacked -- as demonstrators followed through on threats to disrupt President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural ceremonies.
“We are here to let people know this presidency is not legit. It goes against hundreds of years of democracy -- black lives matter,” BLM DC’s Tracye Redd told FoxNews.com.
Among the first to arrive Friday morning was Bill McCann, who planned to join up with Bikers for Trump, after having drove his motorcycle from Fort Worth, Texas.
“Ever since Mr. Trump announced his candidacy, I’ve supported him 100 percent,” said McCann under the light of the Capitol Rotunda, as protesters with the anti-war group Jewish Voice for Peace rallied just blocks away.
McCann spoke under the light of the Capitol Rotunda amid a heavy police presence.
“We’re here to say that whoever is president, ‘No more war,’ ” said Naomi Dann, of Brooklyn. “The incoming president hasn’t said whether he’s a pacifist, but I’m pretty sure he’s not.”
Dann said her concerns and those of other group members include “targeting Muslims” and increased surveillance.
“A lot of people are angry,” she said.

294,"Lisa Lackovitch and her friends from central Virginia weren’t going to miss Donald Trump’s inauguration.
They had stuck by the New York billionaire when the Republican field had ballooned to 17 candidates during the GOP primaries. Their faith stayed strong even when members of their own party tried to discredit him and when the media mocked him. They watched with glee as he picked off his rivals one by one to secure his spot at the top of the Republican ticket.
“We went through the whole campaign with him,” Lackovitch said. “He’s an outsider and we love him!”
For Lackovitch and her friend Julie Patton of Powhatan, Va. -- and thousands of spectators who came to Washington from across the country -- Friday was the culmination of a hard-fought battle against the political establishment.
And it was time to celebrate.
“The people who love Trump are here in masses, and we’re just going to show our support,” Patton said. “We are behind him 100 percent in everything he has said he will do. If anybody can do it, it would be Trump.”
Patton admits she was warned not to come to the nation’s capital because of anti-Trump protests. But even as those protests caused chaos in parts of the District on Friday, supporters like Patton showed their pride and made clear the disruptions weren't going to stop them.
The protests across D.C. grew in intensity as the day went on. Windows were broken, cars damaged and businesses vandalized. Some people threw rocks at police. By mid-afternoon, several officers sustained injuries. Ninety-five people were arrested.
During the inaugural parade, scores of protesters with signs lined up as the first family drove by.
“It’s unfortunate we have that much dissension that’s being displayed today,” George McCaul of Cedar Bluff, Va., told FoxNews.com. He pinned the problems and escalating tension on former President Obama.
“The gentleman -- from when he entered office – has become one of the most divisive presidents that’s ever served in the White House,” McCaul said.
McCaul, however, believes Trump can eventually win over naysayers.
“There’s a lot of hope and enthusiasm and optimism and that’s what’s been evident since the election,” he said.
Security concerns weren’t going to keep South African immigrant Antonio Szilagyi away.
Szilagyi, who now lives in Wilmington, N.C. and voted for Trump, believes it was important to show his support and says he is sure Trump will keep the promises he made on the campaign trail.
“I believe in his policies -- especially securing the border,” Szilagyi said. “It’s very important.”
He added: “Getting rid of political correctness, getting rid of Common Core, repealing and replacing ObamaCare – most definitely he’ll be able to do it.”
Bill Brock of Tennessee is also a fan.
Brock has been to 50 Trump rallies and has followed the new president around the country when he was on the campaign trail. He came to Washington to celebrate his candidate’s win -- and to make a few bucks.
Brock sells Trump memorabilia – everything from “I was there” inauguration lanyards to buttons and hats. His biggest seller is a big blue Trump flag.
“We finally have someone in our White House that actually knows business and who will shake the tree,” Brock told FoxNews.com. “Left or right. It should be what’s best for the country not just if you’re a Republican or Democrat. It’s about getting it right. Period. Business comes first. Two plus two equals four. If it doesn’t, then we need to get those people out [of government].”
A business lesson is exactly what Andre Rissling is hoping his 14-year-old son Jack will take away from the day.
“We support Trump and we support capitalism because capitalism made this country great!” Andre Rissling told FoxNews.com.
One block down the street, a group of four students from the University of North Carolina, decked out in their school colors and red Trump hats, chanted, “Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!”

295,"President Trump, in his first significant official act as president, signed legislation Friday allowing retired Gen. James Mattis to run the Pentagon as defense secretary.
A Senate vote to confirm Mattis, 66, is scheduled for later in the day.
But Trump first needed to sign the bill passed by Congress granting him a waiver to serve, given the law on the books that bars former service members who've been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the top Pentagon job.
Sitting in the Senate reception area less than an hour after assuming office, Trump signed the measure granting Mattis a a one-time exception. Congress last allowed an exception to the law in 1950 for George Marshall, a former five-star Army general.
Trump also signed nomination papers for Cabinet choices and a presidential proclamation declaring a national day of patriotism, according to a tweet from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.
Congressional leaders attended the signing ceremony, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
After the ceremony, Trump gave McConnell the pen he used to sign the papers nominating his wife, Elaine Chao, to head the Transportation Department.
Although Senate Democrats agreed to a vote on Mattis, they are blocking efforts to confirm Mike Pompeo to head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
David Popp, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, told FoxNews.com that Republicans would like to hold ""as many [confirmation] votes as possible,"" but ""that's up to the Democrats.""
Shortly after Trump became president, the Department of Housing and Urban Development also suspended the Obama administration's planned reduction of mortgage insurance premium rates, a move that had been intended to make home ownership more affordable.

296,"Vowing to “get the job done,” President Trump took office Friday outlining a drastically different agenda than that of his predecessor and installing key members of his national security team – as he began the work of turning his bold, and often brash, campaign promises into action.
He took the first steps Friday evening, signing an executive order directing agencies to ease the burdens of the Affordable Care Act. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus also directed agencies to impose an “immediate regulatory freeze.”
“The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action,” Trump declared in his inaugural address earlier on the West Front of the Capitol, issuing a fiery condemnation of business as usual in Washington.
The president presided over the traditional inaugural fanfare, taking part in the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue before an evening of balls and other festivities. But on the sidelines, his team already was making its mark, part of what Trump called a “new vision.”
The official White House website swiftly switched as Trump took the oath of office, reflecting a new agenda for the new administration.
At the top of the “issues” section was Trump’s “America First Energy Plan,” which included a commitment to nix Obama-era policies to curb global warming and regulate U.S. waterways.
Team Trump deemed them “harmful and unnecessary policies” that hurt the economy. “Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,” the website now states.
The site posted additional plans for the military, foreign policy, the economy and more. The jobs plan committed to “pro-growth tax reform” including a reduction in the corporate tax rate.
In terms of official actions, Trump’s first day consisted mostly of routine transfer-of-power measures. He signed nomination papers for his Cabinet picks – but also his first bill, legislation allowing retired Gen. James Mattis to serve as Defense secretary.
The Senate later confirmed Mattis to lead the Pentagon, as well as retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Democrats angered GOP colleagues by resisting efforts to consider more Cabinet nominees on the first day.
But bigger and more visceral battles were playing out on the streets of Washington Friday, as anti-Trump protesters swarmed parts of the District in demonstrations that turned violent at times. Amid dozens of arrests, protesters smashed the windows of businesses, forced the temporary shutdown of security checkpoints and clashed with police – who used pepper spray and tear gas to try to control the crowds.
But thousands of Trump supporters also came out, watching the 45th president’s inaugural address from the National Mall and later the parade, at times drowning out the protesters with cheers.
The address itself was heavy on populist themes, and stitched together by an appeal for a “new national pride,” as Trump described patriotism as a salve for the country’s divisions.
“When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,” he said.
He also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while “the people did not share” in Washington’s wealth.
In blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals – he described “rusted out factories scattered like tombstones” across the land – and the crime in America’s cities.
“This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,” Trump said.
Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down.
“From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first,” Trump said. “I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. … We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.”
Telling the American people this is “your moment” and “your day,” Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: “We will make America great again.”
As Barack and Michelle Obama departed the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation. His team has vowed a “robust” start to the Trump administration, which could include everything from rescinding controversial Obama actions to renegotiating trade deals to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.",negative
297,"A FedEx courier from rural Illinois attending Donald Trump’s inauguration in a donated suit broke down in tears Thursday night when offered a $10,000 check by the commander-in-chief.
“Did that just happen?” Shane Bouvet, 24, of Stonington, asked after meeting Trump backstage at the pre-inauguration concert at the Lincoln Memorial, The Washington Post reported.
Trump read about Bouvet, a struggling single father, in the Post Wednesday and told aides he wanted to meet the man.
The paper reported that Bouvet was invited to attend an inaugural ball as thanks for working on Trump’s campaign in Illinois as a volunteer.
The invite required a suit and a nice pair of shoes, but Bouvet wasn’t sure he could afford that, according to the paper. A friend bought him the suit and got a shoe seller to donate the shoes.
During the meeting with Trump, Bouvet called his father.
“You have a good boy,” Trump told Don Bouvet, according to the paper.
At the end Trump told an aide, “Send him a check for $10,000.”
Bouvet told WAND-TV in Decatur, Ill., that Trump told him he ""would never have to worry again.""
The station reported Friday that Bouvelt said he felt like he was dreaming.
A photo on Trump’s Instagram account shows the president-elect with Bouvet.
“Great to meet one of my earliest and most dedicated supporters!” Trump wrote. “I am deeply humbled by the faith that millions of Americans have placed in me and our movement -- and to those who did not support me, I ask for the chance to be your President too as we make America great again together.”",neutral
298,"Vowing to “get the job done,” President Trump took office Friday outlining a drastically different agenda than that of his predecessor and installing key members of his national security team – as he began the work of turning his bold, and often brash, campaign promises into action.
He took the first steps Friday evening, signing an executive order directing agencies to ease the burdens of the Affordable Care Act. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus also directed agencies to impose an “immediate regulatory freeze.”
“The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action,” Trump declared in his inaugural address earlier on the West Front of the Capitol, issuing a fiery condemnation of business as usual in Washington.
The president presided over the traditional inaugural fanfare, taking part in the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue before an evening of balls and other festivities. But on the sidelines, his team already was making its mark, part of what Trump called a “new vision.”
The official White House website swiftly switched as Trump took the oath of office, reflecting a new agenda for the new administration.
At the top of the “issues” section was Trump’s “America First Energy Plan,” which included a commitment to nix Obama-era policies to curb global warming and regulate U.S. waterways.
Team Trump deemed them “harmful and unnecessary policies” that hurt the economy. “Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,” the website now states.
The site posted additional plans for the military, foreign policy, the economy and more. The jobs plan committed to “pro-growth tax reform” including a reduction in the corporate tax rate.
In terms of official actions, Trump’s first day consisted mostly of routine transfer-of-power measures. He signed nomination papers for his Cabinet picks – but also his first bill, legislation allowing retired Gen. James Mattis to serve as Defense secretary.
The Senate later confirmed Mattis to lead the Pentagon, as well as retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Democrats angered GOP colleagues by resisting efforts to consider more Cabinet nominees on the first day.
But bigger and more visceral battles were playing out on the streets of Washington Friday, as anti-Trump protesters swarmed parts of the District in demonstrations that turned violent at times. Amid dozens of arrests, protesters smashed the windows of businesses, forced the temporary shutdown of security checkpoints and clashed with police – who used pepper spray and tear gas to try to control the crowds.
But thousands of Trump supporters also came out, watching the 45th president’s inaugural address from the National Mall and later the parade, at times drowning out the protesters with cheers.
The address itself was heavy on populist themes, and stitched together by an appeal for a “new national pride,” as Trump described patriotism as a salve for the country’s divisions.
“When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,” he said.
He also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while “the people did not share” in Washington’s wealth.
In blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals – he described “rusted out factories scattered like tombstones” across the land – and the crime in America’s cities.
“This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,” Trump said.
Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down.
“From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first,” Trump said. “I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. … We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.”
Telling the American people this is “your moment” and “your day,” Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: “We will make America great again.”
As Barack and Michelle Obama departed the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation. His team has vowed a “robust” start to the Trump administration, which could include everything from rescinding controversial Obama actions to renegotiating trade deals to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.",negative
299,"While new President Donald Trump was laying out a short version of his agenda in an inaugural speech, his communications team was busy rewriting the White House website with a slew of new objectives including scrapping environmental regulations it claims kill jobs.
Among the commitments was immediate elimination of the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule, two administrative regulations Trump’s predecessor, President Obama, considered environmental safeguards. Team Trump deemed them “harmful and unnecessary policies” that hurt the economy and said so on the official Whitehouse.gov website.
“Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,” the website now states.
KRAUTHAMMER ON TRUMP'S INAUGURAL SPEECH
Trump made clear his administration will seek energy independence for the U.S. by giving a shot in the arm to the oil and gas industries, a platform plank he touted during his successful campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton.
“We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own,” the freshly updated site now states. “We will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure.”
The rapid reversal of prior policy drew a sharp rebuke from environmentalists.
""Minutes after he was sworn in, any illusion that Trump would act in the best interests of families in this country as President were wiped away by a statement of priorities that constitute an historic mistake on one of the key crises facing our planet and an assault on public health,” Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement. “What Trump has released is hardly a plan - it’s a polluter wishlist that will make our air and water dirtier, our climate and international relations more unstable, and our kids sicker. This is a shameful and dark start to Trump’s Presidency, and a slap in the face to any American who thought Trump might pursue the national interest.”
Elsewhere on the official site’s “Issues” section, the new administration spelled out other top priorities, wasting no time in sending a message it plans to aggressively implement the new agenda.
On defense, the site vows to “rebuild” the military to give America firmer footing in pursuing “peace through strength.”
On trade, the Trump administration intends to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The site proposes a moratorium on new federal regulations and states that Trump will order the heads of federal agencies and departments “to identify job-killing regulations that should be repealed.”
On crime, the new policies include plans to deport illegal immigrants with violent criminal records and to safeguard Second Amendment rights, which Trump believes allow Americans to ensure their own safety.
Much of the updated information simply makes official Trump’s campaign promises, but the speed with which they were posted on the site could send a signal to critics and supporters alike that Trump intends to follow through on his agenda.",positive
300,"In his second term as president, gun-control proponent Barack Obama inadvertently became the No. 1 moneymaker for the firearms industry. The past 18 months, in particular, have seen record-breaking gun sales.
But with Donald Trump now at the national helm, and the immediate threat of new federal gun restrictions fizzling, the industry is facing a threat of a different kind: an uncertain economic future and a sudden jam in purchases.
""We don't expect a collapse, we expect organic growth that isn't all fear-driven,"" Lawrence Keane, senior vice president, government and public affairs, for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, told FoxNews.com. ""We are likely to see the market normalize, which is better for the industry long term. It is hard to respond to constant spikes. Slow and steady wins the race.""
The biggest players in the firearms industry convened in Las Vegas this week for the world's largest trade show of its kind, the NSSF-helmed annual Shot Show, where much of the focus was – quite calmly – on what will happen next.
Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump routinely voiced his support for the Second Amendment and pledged that, if elected, he would abolish gun-free zones in schools and military bases and quickly repeal a number of Obama's executive actions, including efforts to streamline the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' background checks on gun buyers.
TRUMP'S PRO-SECOND AMENDMENT PLATFORM COULD END GUN SALES BOOM
But Sandy Zusman, marketing director for Glock, said the industry is still standing by to see exactly what will happen under Trump, who has become notorious for defying expectations.
""The last two years have been exceptional for the industry, much of it driven by the very public discussions Obama had about gun control,"" he said. ""Those discussions have grown quiet now, but everyone is waiting to see the new path. There has been a slowing down of demand; we expect to focus more on individual needs of gun owners now.""
The post-Obama world also means that manufacturers are having to redirect marketing tactics and zero in on more niche audiences. In particular, many are figuring out ways to reach the fast-growing female market, designing products suitable for women's personal defense.
""There has been a huge spike in all-female classes for concealed carry and for competition,"" said Anette Wachter, member of the U.S National Rifle team and founder of a shooting blog, 30CalGirl.com.
Almost all the major manufactures at the Shot Show included females in their marketing materials and advertisements, and not – in Wachter's words – in an old, stereotypical ""gun booth babe"" sense, but portraying the legitimate need for women to bear arms and protect themselves.
Shot Show vendor Drew Vedenhaupt pointed out that the market is still in its post-election ""artificially inflated"" stage, in which many manufacturers overproduced inventory in expectation of panic sales following a presumed Hillary Clinton victory. He said companies are now being forced to sell the overstock at next to no profit to free up room for a new wave of consumer demands.
""We expect customers to take more time with purchasing decisions, and they will turn to buy accessories and things that they really desire – like stylized optics or suppressors,"" Vedenhaupt noted.
GUN-RIGHTS GROUPS HOPE TRUMP NIXES SOCIAL SECURITY ROLE IN BACKGROUND CHECKS
The industry also appears to be turning its targets toward products suitable for the ever-growing arena of competition shooting, which has taken the place of recreational hunting in recent years. According to Vedenhaupt, hunting has fallen into a ""flat"" phase – mostly due to the federal government buying up more and more parcels of land and thus limiting land access. The decrease in hunting has encouraged consumers to gather for more ""group shoots"" and invest time and money in competition instead.
The industry is also gearing up for the high possibility that, with the Republican House and Senate, the newly introduced Reciprocity Act of 2017 will pass under the Trump administration. The controversial measure, which has been referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, would enable concealed carry licenses to function much like driver's licenses in the U.S. – meaning they would be lawfully recognized across state lines. Many firearms-related companies are therefore specializing in accessories and clothing for the concealed carry consumer.
At the 5.11 Tactical booth, for example, the Shot Show hit was seemingly ordinary jeans and pants, made with defender flex denim that enables full range of motion as well as coin pockets deep enough for a knife and hidden carry pockets to shroud a handgun and a magazine.
""We want to provide things that are comfortable and look good,"" President Francisco J. Morales said. ""But with extra functions.""
And while gun makers and lobbyists have a renewed sense of ease at the federal level, they expect the fight to continue in the states as politicians and gun-control groups push for a tightening of laws and restrictions, especially in blue states. In California, for one, the November election saw a host of new laws come into play, including the registration of bullet-button guns and the imposition of ammunition purchase licensing.
But overall, despite the business slowdown, Trump's triumph has been a welcome relief for the firearms industry.
""It has been a very steady Shot Show,"" added Kevin Thomas, sales and marketing manager for Lapua Cartridges and Components. ""There is a sense of optimism among the community that has been missing for the last few years.""",positive
301,"Below is the full text of President Donald Trump's executive order directing federal agencies to ""ease the burden"" of ObamaCare:
MINIMIZING THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PENDING REPEAL
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. It is the policy of my Administration to seek the prompt repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), as amended (the ""Act"").

Sec. 2. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities under the Act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.
Sec. 3. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Secretary and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Act, shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to provide greater flexibility to States and cooperate with them in implementing healthcare programs.
Sec. 4.

Sec. 5. To the extent that carrying out the directives in this order would require revision of regulations issued through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the heads of agencies shall comply with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable statutes in considering or promulgating such regulatory revisions.
Sec. 6. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

302,"Billionaire investor and Democratic donor George Soros said in an interview Thursday that ""people like me"" would like President-elect Donald Trump to fail as president.
He made the comment during an interview with Bloomberg News at his annual media dinner at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The 86-year-old was recently in the news when he reportedly lost nearly $1 billion after Trump's election over a too-cautious approach to the market.
“I personally am convinced that he is going to fail,” Soros said. “Not because of people like me who would like him to fail. But because his ideas that guide him are inherently self-contradictory and the contradictions are actually already embodied by his advisers…and his cabinet.”
Soros Fund Management LLC has about 250 traders and manages about $30 billion. The billionaire took a more active role in the company in anticipation of turmoil in China and the European Union, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Soros, who last year, called on a “global system of political decision-making,” came out strongly against Trump during the campaign. He reportedly contributed $7 million to Priorities USA Action and gave Clinton’s campaign the maximum $2,700 donation. He also contributed $5 million to a super PAC aimed at mobilizing Latinos and other immigrants in hopes to stop the Trump campaign.
Soros has a long history of contributing millions to liberal political causes, and pockets don't get much deeper than his. He ranked No. 23 in the latest Forbes richest men list.
The Wall Street Journal reported that overall, Soros’ fund is up about 5 percent on the year.",neutral
303,"A major Inauguration Day dispute is erupting between Senate Republicans and Democrats over how many of President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees could be confirmed late Friday – and whether the battle could extend into the weekend.
The latest flare-up started Friday morning when Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, sent a tweet saying: ""I am prepared for the Senate to stay in session as long as it takes - all night, all weekend - to confirm President Trump's cabinet nominees.""
""That’s what I’m prepared to do,"" Cornyn later told Fox News, while chiding Democrats for alleged delays in the confirmation process.
""This sort of tactic up front -- there's no dishonor in losing an election. But how you conduct yourself afterwards says a lot. All they can do is delay for delay’s sake.""
Senate Republicans hold a 52-seat majority as Trump prepares to take office, meaning if they hold together they can eventually confirm every one of Trump’s nominees. Democrats, however, can slow down the process and certainly prevent most from being confirmed on Day One.
Cornyn added that since this is the first major dispute of the incoming Trump administration, Senate Republicans should ""push back and push back hard. This strikes me as having the attributes of being a sore loser.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, says his side is only prepared to confirm two nominees Friday: John Kelly to become Homeland Security secretary and James Mattis to run the Pentagon.
Schumer says the Democrats will permit debate on the nomination of Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., to be CIA director. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., is pushing for debate on that nomination, which could hold up the process until Monday.
Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., was more strident in his comments about the Democrats’ approach and was more willing to stick around until the nominees are done.
“We’ve got to seat a Cabinet. And we have to get it done. We have to get a defense team in place. This isn’t gamesmanship,” said Rounds.
Rounds noted he is scheduled to preside over the Senate for a period Friday evening and that, at this point, no one else is scheduled to preside after him.
“I’ll volunteer,” Cornyn said.
A senior Senate Republican source told Fox News that Democrats are trying to be “d---s” and that to play with the national security team – during a time of transition – is dangerous.
There is talk that Trump would like to go to the CIA on Saturday. But that could be a problem if the Senate hasn’t confirmed Pompeo.
When it comes to confirmations, Cornyn says he wants “parity” on Trump’s inauguration day, considering the Senate approved seven of President Obama’s nominations just hours after he took office eight years ago. But going from two confirmations to seven is a problem.
The Senate also had approved Obama’s nominees on what’s called a “voice vote,” not taking a formal tally. However, Schumer says he will require roll-call votes on both Kelly and Mattis.",negative
304,"The smart thing about President Trump’s serious and sober speech is that he didn’t make it about him.
The populist tone was unmistakable from the outset as the man so long dismissed by the media and political establishment talked about giving the government back to the people: “This is your day, your celebration.”
That may be a common rhetorical device, but Trump’s campaign was so personality-focused that this was a refreshing approach.
Plus, the short speech made clear that the master showman knows something about not boring his audience.
This was not a conservative speech. There was not even a nod to the notion of shrinking the size of government, not even a Clintonian “the era of big government is over.” That is not Trump’s passion.
The headline that he had in mind—“America First”—has unfortunate historical overtones from the pre-World War II era, as liberal pundits quickly pointed out. But it fit nicely into Trump’s themes of getting tougher with other countries on trade, immigration and shouldering the cost of their defense.
What struck me is how the man who ran against the Republican establishment said it didn’t matter which party controlled the White House, as long as the people had the power. He augmented this with his standard refrain about ending the era of “all talk and no action.”
The new president seemed to be addressing those who elected him when he spoke of “the forgotten men and women” and how “the establishment protects itself,” leaving little to celebrate for struggling families.” That is what enabled him to win over some hope-and-change voters from 2008.
There were bows to the other side, beginning with his praise of Barack and Michelle Obama for their “magnificent” help. He talked about “mothers and children, trapped in poverty in our inner cities…and the crime, and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.”
Those passages, and Trump’s declaration that “this American carnage stops right here,” were sharply criticized by MSNBC commentators as too dark. But I saw it as a recognition that minorities and the poor, most of whom voted for Hillary Clinton, are also on his radar.
The 45th president wound up by telling those on the West Front of the Capitol and those watching at home that “your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny.”
Like everything surrounding Donald Trump, the speech is already stirring praise and criticism. Now the challenge for the new president—and the country—is to see whether he can match the expectations of his inaugural address.",positive
305,"Donald Trump assumed the nation’s highest office Friday as the 45th president of the United States, vowing in a tough inaugural address to restore prosperity and “fight” for the country “with every breath.”
In a succinct speech heavy on populist themes, the new president told Americans across the country they will “never be ignored again” and promised concrete results.
“The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action,” he said.
The president addressed a packed crowd of spectators stretching from the Capitol across the National Mall on a mild but overcast and at-times drizzly day, after taking the oath of office along with Vice President Mike Pence. The speech did not delve into policy details, and rather reprised objectives from his 2016 campaign on trade, immigration and national security.
FULL TEXT OF TRUMP SPEECH
But the address was stitched together, more broadly, by an appeal for a “new national pride” and a rediscovery of American patriotism, as he described this as a salve for the country’s divisions.
“When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,” he said.
He also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while “the people did not share” in Washington’s wealth.
The address completes Trump’s remarkable journey from political outsider written off by countless Beltway pundits to the most powerful man in the country. His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway noted in an earlier interview with Fox News that Trump was “making history” as a businessman with no prior political or military experience – someone successful in the private sector coming to Washington “owing nobody anything.”
In blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump on Friday lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals – he described “rusted out factories scattered like tombstones” across the land – and the crime in America’s cities.
“This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,” Trump said.
Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down.
“From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first,” Trump said. “I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. … We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.”
He also vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism.
Telling the American people this is “your moment” and “your day,” Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: “We will make America great again.”
As Barack and Michelle Obama depart the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation. His team has vowed a “robust” start to the Trump administration, which could include everything from rescinding controversial Obama actions to renegotiating trade deals to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.
An immediate task for the new administration will be to get Trump’s Cabinet nominees confirmed. His advisers have complained that Democrats are slowing the process, and resisting the kind of swift confirmation the Senate gave many of Obama’s nominees in 2009.
Before he spoke on Friday, throngs of protesters were causing disruptions on the edges of the security zone in Washington. Some blocked checkpoints and forced their temporary closure earlier Friday morning, while elsewhere demonstrators resorted to violence and vandalism. They clashed with police later in the afternoon, amid dozens of arrests.
While dozens of House Democrats boycotted Friday’s ceremonies – a move that fueled disputes with Trump’s team over the weekend – other prominent Democrats and past presidents of both parties were in attendance for the transfer of power. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, whose loss to Trump marked one of the biggest upsets in modern political history, attended and tweeted shortly before Trump took the oath that she came to “honor our democracy & its enduring values.”
“I will never stop believing in our country & its future,” she wrote.

306,"Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat slammed outgoing President Barack Obama and praised President-elect Donald Trump in an official video released Thursday.
In the video, Barkat urges Israelis to sign a letter urging Trump to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem – a move that Obama suggested Wednesday could be “explosive.”
“My fellow citizens, during the last eight years, the Obama administration has pushed for a settlement-building freeze, has surrendered to the Iranians and radical Islam and abandoned Israel to a hostile U.N. resolution,” Barkat said.
The mayor also urges Israelis to accept Trump as their friend. The video cuts away to Trump addressing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and vowing to move the embassy to Jerusalem.
Relations between the White House and Israel have grown contentious over the tail end of Obama’s presidency, culminating in an abstention of a U.N. vote that cleared the way for condemnation of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Some of Trump’s incoming administration has been split on whether to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. The Washington Post noted that most of the world doesn’t recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. East Jerusalem is also considered “occupied territory,” which Palestinians hope to call their capital if a two-state solution is ever reached.
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump’s U.N. ambassador, said Wednesday that she would back the embassy move, while Trump’s Defense Secretary nominee retired Marine Gen. James Mattis said he would “stick to U.S. policy” regarding Jerusalem.
Trump’s next ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, supports Israeli settlements and other changes to U.S. policies in the region.
Friedman said he looked forward to carrying out his duties from ""the U.S. embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem,"" even though the embassy is in Tel Aviv. Trump advisers have said that the president-elect will follow through on his call for moving the embassy.
The letter Barkat plans to send to Trump has gathered more than 10,000 signatures. Barkat’s spokesman Ari Lerner told The Post that Barkat paid for the video himself and it wasn’t intended to be an attack on Obama.",positive
307,"I was sitting on the set of “Outnumbered,” ad-libbing for an hour as Donald Trump landed in Washington yesterday, when the visual struck me.
He and his family didn’t descend from the familiar blue-and-white Trump plane. They walked off a plane emblazoned with United States of America.
That, for me, made the transition of power real. The next time Trump gets on a plane, he will be saluting the lingering military folks as commander-in-chief. The nuclear codes will be traveling with him.
This is what it all comes down to. Nineteen months after coming down that Trump Tower escalator, the outsider given little chance by the media and political establishment will become the ultimate insider, the most powerful man on the planet.
And that’s why I find it particularly sad that 68 House Democrats are boycotting the peaceful transition of power. Which means, in the Beltway’s blood-feud culture, many Republicans are likely to be busy the next time a Democratic president is inaugurated.
For the 45th president, it is time to stand and deliver. As Barack Obama found, soaring campaign rhetoric doesn’t necessarily translate into effective governing.
Trump’s continuing warfare with the media may provide the backdrop for the next four years, but the country—especially those who voted for him—will be looking for results.
Can Trump generate plenty of good-paying jobs? Can he find a workable replacement for ObamaCare? Can he hammer out better trade deals? Can he get the wall built? Can he cut taxes and boost military spending and infrastructure spending without exploding the deficit?
And can he cut the necessary deals, not just with the Democrats but with the conservative wing of the GOP?
If Trump accomplishes some of those things, will the press begin treating him as a more “normal” president, rather than a dangerous one?
Or, if he gets mired in the Washington swamp, will the people who put him into office become disillusioned?
Trump may be our only president without political or military experience, but he is also, in a sense, the first independent president of the modern era, who wasn’t supported by the leaders of either party.
And he’s the first president with a powerful Twitter account, which helped get him elected but may be less useful at helping to forge the compromises that keep the wheels of government spinning.
And what will be the role of Melania, the nation’s second foreign-born first lady, who does not seek the political spotlight and, for now, is remaining behind at Trump Tower?
After Trump landed in the nation’s capital, the motorcade took him to his opulent new Trump hotel, the former Old Post Office Building. When everyone in the press was convinced that Hillary was going to win, the joke was that was the closest he’d get to sleeping on Pennsylvania Avenue. But on Friday night, Donald J. Trump will sleep in the white mansion five blocks to the west—and the country is in for quite a ride.",negative
308,"In his first hours as president Friday, Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to ""ease the burden"" of ObamaCare while his chief of staff directed an immediate regulatory freeze.
Trump was joined in the Oval Office by Vice President Mike Pence, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and other top advisers as he signed the executive order on former President Barack Obama's signature health law, which Trump opposed throughout his campaign.
The order, which noted that Trump intends to seek the law's ""prompt repeal,"" directs agencies to ""minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens [of ObamaCare] and prepare to afford the States more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market."" It also tells agencies to waive, defer or delay imposing any ObamaCare provisions that impose fiscal penalties on states, health care providers, families or individuals.
Trump's order also ordered agency heads to ""encourage the development of a free and open market in interstate commerce for the offering of healthcare services and health insurance,"" a key component of Republicans' ObamaCare replacement plan.
Priebus' memo says that agencies shouldn't submit any regulations to be published in the Federal Register unless a Trump-selected agency head approves it. That appears to mean that some regulations that had been approved by Obama's administration would be halted. It also freezes any regulations that are already in the pipeline to be published and allows time for other pending regulations to be reviewed by Trump's administration.
The memo is similar to one that Obama's chief of staff issued the day Obama was inaugurated in 2009.
Trump also signed the commissions for his first two Cabinet appointments. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly were easily confirmed by the Senate earlier in the day. Both men were formally sworn in by Pence in a hastily arranged ceremony in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where the vice president's suite of offices is located.
Asked about his first day as president, Trump described it as ""busy but good -- a beautiful day.""
Most of Trump's first substantive acts as president will wait until Monday, his first full work day at the White House.
Shortly after being sworn in, Trump switched between the official business of governing and the pageantry of his inauguration, making his first official moves as president in an ornate room steps from the Senate floor. Flanked by Pence and congressional leaders before his congressional luncheon, Trump praised each of his Cabinet nominees as he signed the papers formalizing their nominations. He also engaged in banter with his new congressional rivals, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California.
There were others signs the new government was up and running. Federal websites and agencies immediately began reflecting the transfer of power, and WhiteHouse.gov was revamped for Trump's policy priorities as pages about LGBT rights and the Obama administration's climate change plan were eliminated.
Shortly after Trump became president, the Department of Housing and Urban Development suspended the Obama administration's planned reduction of mortgage insurance premium rates, a move that had been intended to make buying a home more affordable.
More significant policy announcements are expected in the early days of the Trump administration.
Trump's spokesman has said the president intends to withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, which he views as detrimental to U.S. businesses and workers. He has also promised to renegotiate the two-decades-old Clinton era North American Free Trade Agreement or withdraw from it.
Given Trump's opposition to Obama's immigration actions, he could also cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which has protected about 750,000 young immigrants from deportation. The program also offered those immigrants work permits.
Trump also faces an early choice of naming a Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Trump has said he will announce a nominee in about two weeks.
Other issues poised to receive early action include energy, where Trump is likely to undo regulations on oil drilling and coal, and cybersecurity, where he has already said he will ask for a report on the strength of the nation's cyber defenses within 90 days of taking office.

309,"As President Trump’s limousine drove the Washington, D.C. parade route on Friday, the Senate was busy at work stocking Trump’s Cabinet – though not fully.
Gen. James Mattis was confirmed as Secretary of Defense and Gen. John Kelly was confirmed as Secretary of Homeland Security in a pair of Friday evening votes.
Mattis was approved by a vote of 98-1. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was the lone vote against. Kelly was approved 88-11. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., did not vote on either Kelly or Mattis. Sessions has been nominated to be Attorney General.
Trump signed the commissions for Mattis and Kelly later Friday. Vice President Mike Pence swore in both Generals.
TRUMP OUTLINES NEW VISION FOR AMERICA
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also tried to begin debate on Rep. Mike Pompeo’s nomination as CIA Director following the Mattis and Kelly votes, but Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., objected. Instead, the Senate was set to begin the Pompeo debate on Monday.
“I am pleased by the confirmation votes of Generals Mattis and Kelly,"" Trump said in a statement. ""These uniquely qualified leaders will immediately begin the important work of rebuilding our military, defending our nation and securing our borders. I am proud to have these two American heroes join my administration.
""I call on members of the Senate to fulfill their constitutional obligation and swiftly confirm the remainder of my highly qualified cabinet nominees, so that we can get to work on behalf of the American people without further delay.”
Noting the Senate approved seven of former President Obama’s Cabinet nominees on the first day of his administration in 2009, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chastised Democrats for refusing to consider confirmation of more of Trump’s nominees. McCain said the only difference between 2009 and 2017 is that now “we’ve got a world on fire,” citing Syrian refugees and Russia’s aggressive actions.
“We need a new Director of the CIA more than ever,” McCain said.
Wyden, however, countered that the Senate would not be Trump’s “rubber stamp.”
Trump earlier Friday signed into law a waiver allowing Mattis to serve as Defense Secretary. The bill passed by Congress last week granted Mattis a one-time exception from federal law barring former U.S. service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the top Pentagon job. The restriction is meant to preserve civilian control of the military. Mattis, 66, retired from the Marine Corps in 2013 after a 41-year career in uniform.
FORRESTER: 4 LESSONS MATTIS TAUGHT ME
During that same signing ceremony, Trump joked with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about Pompeo’s confirmation.
""Mike Pompeo. Great. They tell me he's going to be approved momentarily, but you never know with this place,"" Trump said.
Schumer retorted: ""Depends how you define momentarily — soon.""
There was little debate about the confirmation of Kelly, who is widely respected by Democrats and Republicans alike. As the former head of the military's Southern Command, based in South Florida, he routinely worked with the Department of Homeland Security to combat human trafficking and drug smuggling.
Kelly joined the Marine Corps in 1970 and served three tours in Iraq. He was also the highest-ranking officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Marine 1st Lt. Robert Kelly, was killed in November 2010 in Afghanistan.

310,"Below is the full text of President Trump's inaugural speech:
Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.
We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.
Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.
We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.
Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.
Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.
For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.
Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth.
Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed.
The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.
It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.
This is your day. This is your celebration.
And this, the United States of America, is your country.
What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
Everyone is listening to you now.
You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.
At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.
But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
We are one nation – and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;
Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;
We've defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own;
And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.
One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.
The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.
But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.
We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.
From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
From this moment on, it’s going to be America First.
Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down.
America will start winning again, winning like never before.
We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.
We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.
We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.
We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.
We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.
At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
The Bible tells us, “how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.”
We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.
When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected.
We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.
Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.
In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.
The time for empty talk is over.
Now arrives the hour of action.
Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.
We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.
A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.
It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.
And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.
So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:
You will never be ignored again.
Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.
We Will Make America Proud Again.
We Will Make America Safe Again.
And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.",negative
311,"Tensions flared over Democrats’ resistance to President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees on the eve of his inauguration, as senators traded jabs on the sidelines of his Treasury pick’s confirmation hearing and the transition team squared off from afar with the chamber’s Democratic boss.
Incoming Press Secretary Sean Spicer said at a pre-inaugural briefing Thursday there’s “no excuse” for what he called “delay tactics” in confirming Trump’s team, as Republicans push to have as many as seven nominees confirmed right away.
But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., while denying they’re trying to drag out the process, said Thursday that Democrats only expect to vote Friday on Homeland Security secretary nominee John Kelly and Defense secretary nominee James Mattis.
Meanwhile, the confirmation hearing for Steve Mnuchin as Treasury secretary turned feisty as lawmakers grilled him on his banking career – and bickered over one Republican’s joke gone bad.
The former Goldman Sachs banker’s hearing got off to a shaky start when Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., joked he should give ranking member Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a Valium pill for the questioning.
“Senator Wyden, I’ve got a Valium pill here that you might want to take before the second round,” Roberts said. “Just a suggestion, sir.”
Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown butted in and fired back, saying he hopes the “comment about Valium doesn’t set the tone for 2017 in this committee.” He added, “This is just outrageous.”
After a minute of back-and-forth bickering, Wyden, the committee’s top Democrat, said that “we have many colleagues waiting.”
Roberts snapped, “Fine Ron, I’m done.”
Nearly all of the Democrats on the committee as well as one Republican, Sen. Dean Heller, took Mnuchin to task for more than three hours of questioning – then went on a break – and returned for round two.
The tone was in keeping with the tense nature of several recent Cabinet hearings, which fueled Spicer's criticism of the process on Thursday.
Wyden criticized Mnuchin over his use of a “dynasty trust” which “shields tens of millions of dollars from taxes.” He also chastised the New York banker for using a tax-exempt foundation to push for the approval of his bank’s merger.
As questioning continued, the staff for Democrats on the committee circulated a memo that claimed Mnuchin failed to initially disclose close to $100 million of his assets on disclosure documents sent to the Senate Finance Committee. The memo also claimed he forgot to mention his role as a director for an investment fund located in a tax haven.
Democrats pounced and said the omissions should disqualify Mnuchin as a suitable fit for Treasury secretary.
“The Treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all Americans, including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities,” Wyden said. “When I look at Mr. Mnuchin’s background, it’s a stretch to find evidence he’d be that kind of Treasury secretary.”
Wyden also turned his attention to Mnuchin and accused the Wall Street banker of putting “more vulnerable people on the street faster than just about anybody else” during widespread foreclosures on homeowners across the country.
Mnuchin said that after he was nominated by Trump as Treasury secretary he had “been maligned as taking advantage of others’ hardships in order to earn a buck.”
“Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said, adding, “I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures. I ran a ‘Loan Modification Machine.’ Whenever we could do loan modifications, we did them.”
Mnuchin told the Senate Finance Committee that his bank extended over 100,000 loan modifications to borrowers who had fallen behind in their mortgage payments.
Mnuchin said whenever possible OneWest offered loan modifications using guidelines from a variety of government programs, but ""unfortunately, not all of the homes could be saved through these programs and despite my best efforts, some were sadly subject to foreclosure.""
After being nominated for the Treasury job in November, Mnuchin said his bank's foreclosures reflected the fact that before he took over the failed IndyMac, it had accumulated one of the worst portfolios of bad mortgage loans ""in the history of time.""
A group of 10 Democratic senators led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren participated in a forum Wednesday to hear testimony from some of the people who lost their homes after Mnuchin's bank foreclosed.
""OneWest was notorious for its belligerence and for its cruelty,"" Warren said.
Liberal groups began airing a television ad on the foreclosures seeking to bring pressure on five Republican senators, including Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Dean Heller of Nevada, who are both members of the Finance Committee, to vote against Mnuchin.
""Steven Mnuchin, the foreclosure king, made millions by taking people's homes with no regard to anything but his own bottom line,"" said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, one of the groups running the ad.
But Mnuchin's supporters include Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. He called Mnuchin a ""leader and a manager through his career, demonstrating an ability to make tough decisions and to be accountable.""
Mnuchin, who as Treasury secretary would serve as the administration's chief economic spokesman, faced questions about Trump's ambitious plans to double the country's growth rate through tax cuts, reducing government regulations and boosting government spending on infrastructure projects.

313,"Vowing to make America ""greater than ever before,"" President-elect Donald Trump rallied cheering supporters at the Lincoln Memorial Thursday evening just hours away from taking the oath of office.
“This is a movement that has never been seen like this, anywhere in the world,” Trump told a crowd of thousands, gathered to see not only the president-elect but the free concert of country and rock acts in the shadow of the Washington Monument.
On President Obama's last full day in office, Trump and his team made the rounds across Washington to prepare for the transfer of power on Friday. Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and their families landed in the nation’s capital earlier Thursday morning, making his last journey from New York as a private citizen -- 18 months after launching a presidential bid that was largely written off by the pundits at the time.
“We are going to unify the country. We are going to make this country great again for everybody,” Trump told supporters, before scaling the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with his family as the U.S. Army Band played patriotic songs and fireworks lit up the night sky.
It was a very Trumpian end to Inauguration Eve.
Earlier in the day, the pair attended a Republican leadership luncheon held at the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington, just blocks from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
He and Pence were joined by incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Presidential Inauguration Committee Chairman Tom Barrack and CEO Sarah Armstrong, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as other Cabinet nominees and Trump administration staff.
Soon-to-be first lady Melania briefly addressed the gathering and then handed off to Trump, who tossed praise and recognition to those in the audience, including Health and Human Secretary nominee Rep. Tom Price, before the pool camera was removed from the room.
“We are all ready to go to work,” Pence said at a morning appearance. “In fact, we can’t wait to get to work for the American people to make it great again.”
The first official event of the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States was a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery.
While Trump paid respects to the nation’s military and veterans, supporters were making their way to the National Mall and the Lincoln Memorial to secure spots for the Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration, the concert featuring country singer Toby Keith, Lee Greenwood and the band 3 Doors Down.

Secretary of Housing and Urban Development nominee Ben Carson, Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions and longtime adviser Rudy Giuliani were seated to the side of the podium as Pence spoke. Pence said his primary purpose was to thank ""the team that got us here to this day at the direction of the president-elect.""
""When you see a box turtle on a fence post, you know he had some help getting there,"" Pence said.
Trump is hoping to have a number of his Cabinet nominees confirmed on Friday hours after he officially takes office. Several of his top nominees -- including Secretary of Defense nominee Gen. James Mattis and Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson -- have already had confirmation hearings. Republicans, at the least, would like the national security team confirmed on Day 1.
Spicer chided Democratic senators who have threatened to hold up some of the votes and have led aggressive questioning of the nominees so far. Spicer said there’s “no excuse” for what he called “delay tactics” and “partisanship.”
One pick who likely won't be confirmed for Day 1 is Perdue, long-rumored to fill the Agriculture post but not officially named until Thursday.
“Sonny Perdue is going to accomplish great things as Secretary of Agriculture,” Trump said in a statement. “From growing up on a farm to being governor of a big agriculture state, he has spent his whole life understanding and solving the challenges our farmers face, and he is going to deliver big results for all Americans who earn their living off the land.”
Perdue, 70, would be the first Southerner in the post in more than two decades. The last three agriculture secretaries have been from Iowa, North Dakota and Nebraska.
“Beginning as a simple Georgia farm boy, making sure Americans who make their livelihood in the agriculture industry are thriving is near and dear to my heart, and I’m going to champion the concerns of American agriculture and work tirelessly to solve the issues facing our farm families in this new role,"" Perdue said in a statement.
REPUBLICANS PUSHING TO CONFIRM SLATE OF TRUMP NOMINEES ON DAY 1
Perdue began his political career as a Democrat in the Georgia Legislature in the 1990s. After switching his allegiance to the Republican Party, he was elected governor in 2002. Perdue focused on finding ways to save money while improving customer service by state agencies — such as reducing wait times for renewing driver's licenses. He often referred to himself as Georgia's CEO.
""If I could choose my legacy it would be the epithet that ‘he made government work,’"" Perdue told The Associated Press in 2010 before he left office. ""That's really what I've focused on. It's not some big monument.""
Under Perdue's watch, Georgia adopted tough food-safety regulations after a deadly U.S. salmonella outbreak was traced to Georgia-made peanut butter. He moved the state office that issues water permits for irrigation and other agricultural uses from Atlanta to rural south Georgia, where it would be closer to farmers. And Perdue poured millions of state dollars into Go Fish, a program that aimed to lure bass fishing tournaments to the state.
The ex-governor, whose full name is George Ervin Perdue III, was born in rural Perry, Georgia. He attended the University of Georgia, where he played football as a walk-on and earned a doctorate in veterinary medicine. Following a stint in the Air Force, he returned to Georgia and settled in Bonaire, a city of about 14,000 people.

316,"President-elect Donald Trump has asked roughly 50 senior Obama administration appointees to remain in their posts after his inauguration to ensure continuity in government, his incoming White House press secretary said Thursday.
The officials include the highest-ranking career officials at key national security agencies like the Pentagon and State Department.
Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work and America's third-ranking diplomat, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon, will serve as acting chiefs of their agencies until successors for the top jobs are confirmed by the Senate, Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer said.
Thursday's announcement comes after weeks of questions about how Trump's team is managing the presidential transition, although it may not address broader concerns about what officials at many federal agencies have said is a lack of communication with the incoming team.
Such concerns are natural in presidential transitions. But the confusion among officials at national security agencies could have consequences, given their international engagements. The rest of the world doesn't pause while Washington determines its chains of command.
Work will likely helm the Defense Department for only a matter of hours. Trump's selection for the Pentagon, retired Gen. James Mattis, is expected to be confirmed on Friday shortly after the inauguration ceremony, along with retired Gen. John Kelly for Secretary of Homeland Security.
Senate debate on Trump's choice for CIA boss, former Rep. Mike Pompeo, is expected to start Friday. It is unclear if Pompeo will receive an immediate confirmation vote.
At the State Department, Shannon will be in charge until at least until next week as a Senate vote on Trump's choice for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, isn't expected until Monday or Tuesday.
Also staying will be Brett McGurk, the Obama administration's point-man for fighting the Islamic State (ISIS) group, Nicholas Rasmussen, the National Counterterrorism Center director, and Adam Szubin, the Treasury Department's top official for terrorism and financial intelligence.
Spicer said Chuck Rosenberg, the Drug Enforcement Agency administrator, and Susan Coppedge, the State Department's ambassador-at-large to combat human trafficking, would be left in place for the transition.
The National Institutes of Health said its director, Dr. Francis Collins, was asked to stay on at least temporarily.
A full list of Obama appointees asked to remain was not immediately available.
It also wasn't clear if the Trump administration would accept an invitation to attend Russian-supported Syria peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Monday.
Trump has made a great point about seeking closer cooperation with Moscow on counterterrorism and security matters. Obama's special envoy for Syria, Michael Ratney, has indicated he is willing to attend, but the transition team hadn't instructed him to make the trip. Spicer said an announcement was expected soon.
As in previous transitions, U.S. embassies and consulates abroad headed by noncareer, presidential appointee ambassadors will transfer to the most senior career diplomat present until the new administration fills the top posts.
The transition team has largely yielded on matters of national security to retired Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, and Jared Kushner, the president-elect's son-in-law. But the circle will have to be expanded once the new administration assumes the full responsibility of government.
When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the Senate confirmed seven Cabinet members on Inauguration Day.

Meanwhile, the confirmation hearing for Steve Mnuchin as Treasury secretary turned feisty as lawmakers grilled him on his banking career – and bickered over one Republican’s joke gone bad.
The former Goldman Sachs banker’s hearing got off to a shaky start when Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., joked he should give ranking member Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a Valium pill for the questioning.
“Senator Wyden, I’ve got a Valium pill here that you might want to take before the second round,” Roberts said. “Just a suggestion, sir.”
Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown butted in and fired back, saying he hopes the “comment about Valium doesn’t set the tone for 2017 in this committee.” He added, “This is just outrageous.”
After a minute of back-and-forth bickering, Wyden, the committee’s top Democrat, said that “we have many colleagues waiting.”
Roberts snapped, “Fine Ron, I’m done.”
Nearly all of the Democrats on the committee as well as one Republican, Sen. Dean Heller, took Mnuchin to task for more than three hours of questioning – then went on a break – and returned for round two.
The tone was in keeping with the tense nature of several recent Cabinet hearings, which fueled Spicer's criticism of the process on Thursday.
Wyden criticized Mnuchin over his use of a “dynasty trust” which “shields tens of millions of dollars from taxes.” He also chastised the New York banker for using a tax-exempt foundation to push for the approval of his bank’s merger.
As questioning continued, the staff for Democrats on the committee circulated a memo that claimed Mnuchin failed to initially disclose close to $100 million of his assets on disclosure documents sent to the Senate Finance Committee. The memo also claimed he forgot to mention his role as a director for an investment fund located in a tax haven.
Democrats pounced and said the omissions should disqualify Mnuchin as a suitable fit for Treasury secretary.
“The Treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all Americans, including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities,” Wyden said. “When I look at Mr. Mnuchin’s background, it’s a stretch to find evidence he’d be that kind of Treasury secretary.”
Wyden also turned his attention to Mnuchin and accused the Wall Street banker of putting “more vulnerable people on the street faster than just about anybody else” during widespread foreclosures on homeowners across the country.
Mnuchin said that after he was nominated by Trump as Treasury secretary he had “been maligned as taking advantage of others’ hardships in order to earn a buck.”
“Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said, adding, “I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures. I ran a ‘Loan Modification Machine.’ Whenever we could do loan modifications, we did them.”
Mnuchin told the Senate Finance Committee that his bank extended over 100,000 loan modifications to borrowers who had fallen behind in their mortgage payments.
Mnuchin said whenever possible OneWest offered loan modifications using guidelines from a variety of government programs, but ""unfortunately, not all of the homes could be saved through these programs and despite my best efforts, some were sadly subject to foreclosure.""
After being nominated for the Treasury job in November, Mnuchin said his bank's foreclosures reflected the fact that before he took over the failed IndyMac, it had accumulated one of the worst portfolios of bad mortgage loans ""in the history of time.""
A group of 10 Democratic senators led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren participated in a forum Wednesday to hear testimony from some of the people who lost their homes after Mnuchin's bank foreclosed.
""OneWest was notorious for its belligerence and for its cruelty,"" Warren said.
Liberal groups began airing a television ad on the foreclosures seeking to bring pressure on five Republican senators, including Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Dean Heller of Nevada, who are both members of the Finance Committee, to vote against Mnuchin.
""Steven Mnuchin, the foreclosure king, made millions by taking people's homes with no regard to anything but his own bottom line,"" said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, one of the groups running the ad.
But Mnuchin's supporters include Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. He called Mnuchin a ""leader and a manager through his career, demonstrating an ability to make tough decisions and to be accountable.""
Mnuchin, who as Treasury secretary would serve as the administration's chief economic spokesman, faced questions about Trump's ambitious plans to double the country's growth rate through tax cuts, reducing government regulations and boosting government spending on infrastructure projects.

318,"Incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told Fox News Thursday that President-elect Donald Trump would ""bring a businessman approach to government"" as the 45th President of the United States.
Speaking on the eve of Trump's inauguration, Spicer told ""The First 100 Days"" host Martha MacCallum that the new administration would examine ""whether or not taxpayer money is being used [in] the most efficient and effective way.""
""How do we deliver the best products and service to the American people in a way that respects their tax dollars and does so in a way that promotes efficiency, but also provides them a better product?"" Spicer asked. ""That status quo is just not acceptable anymore and business as usual is over.""
The incoming press secretary played down a report that the Trump transition team had laid out a blue print to reduce federal spending by $10.5 trillion over 10 years. However, he did say the administration would ensure that the most essential posts were filled.
""The president-elect has asked 51 individuals [from the Obama administration ]to stay in critical posts to ensure the best continuity of government [and] that we are prepared [on] day one,"" Spicer said. ""We’ve got a lot of the deputy secretaries, undersecretaries and assistant secretaries ready to go. Now that the Cabinet is fully filled out, you’re going to see a flurry of activity.""
Spicer added that department and agency heads have been asked to review their budgets and staffing levels.
""So, if there’s a [duplicate] job or one that’s no longer relevant,"" he said, ""then yeah, we’re going to make sure we don’t disrespect the taxpayer.""",neutral
319,"Danny Hamilton, owner of Georgia-based Star Coaches, says his company has rented luxury buses to hundreds of celebrities, including Tim McGraw, Darius Rucker, Michael Jackson and even Hillary Clinton.
But despite the Democrats on his client list, he is a stalwart supporter of President-elect Donald Trump. During the campaign, he even covered one of his coaches in Trump-themed wrapping and drove it around Georgia.
“Why not wrap Trump around it and turn Georgia red?"" Hamilton said. “That’s what I did.”
After Trump won Georgia and the presidency itself, Hamilton covered five more buses in “Make America Great Again!!!!” wrapping and offered rides to Trump’s inauguration. The project culminated this week when more than 70 Trump enthusiasts left Atlanta, arriving early Thursday morning at an RV campsite in College Park, Md., just outside Washington, D.C.
“We got a bunch of folks that’s really enjoying what we’re doing and it ain’t breaking the bank and we’re just having a good time,” said Wallace Mathis of Cordele, Ga.
“I think it's going to be one of the greatest moments in history for the United States,” said Kim McCarthy of Alpharetta, Georgia. “I think he's going to be one of the best presidents we've ever had.”
Liz Craig, a Star Coaches driver, led the 650-mile, six-bus caravan and also has tickets to the inauguration.
“We had a really smooth, smooth ride, typical traffic here and there – a lot of support, lot of people driving by honking their horns, waving to us, really a lot of support,” she said.
Hamilton’s businesses, meanwhile, rely on customers in the entertainment industry, and he said he’s concerned some clients may choose a competitor because of his Trump support. So far, though, he’s seen no drop in his business.
“February looks good,” he said. “I was worried, but it’s looking good.”

320,"There is business to be done on Inauguration Day in the United States Senate.
But it will come late in the day.
Long after the swearing-in of President-elect Trump. Hours following the helicopter departure from the Capitol of President Obama via “Executive One.” It’s designated as such because the former president is on board, having just bid farewell to the new president. And we haven’t even mentioned the special inauguration luncheon on Statuary Hall of the Capitol.
Consider the bill of fare:
Did guests prefer the J. Lohr 2013 Arroyo Vista Chardonnay paired with the Maine lobster and Gulf shrimp -- with saffron sauce and peanut crumble? Or did the Delicato Black Stallion 2012 Limited Release Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon go better with the Angus beef -- with dark chocolate and juniper jus and potato gratin?
The House and Senate are in fact in session Friday. The inauguration itself constitutes a Joint Session of Congress – just outside. The House gavels in Friday morning but won’t really do anything. Technically, the Senate is in too at that point (there’s a debate about whether to raise the flag over the Senate wing of the Capitol, denoting the Senate meeting). But unlike its companion body, the Senate will conduct the first business of the Trump administration sometime after 4 p.m. ET.
The question … is how much.
The Senate will focus on confirming some of the new president’s nominees. Republicans certainly have the votes to confirm many of Trump’s picks. But for now, Democrats can determine how many nominees the Senate can advance on Inauguration Day and how many they can delay.
Senate Republicans are pushing for the confirmation of seven nominees. But in reality, Trump will only get three or four on Friday. Maybe five at the most.
“Seven sounds like a good number,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas. “Seven is the number in 2009. I would expect parity.”
Seven is magnificent for Republicans because that’s how many nominees the Senate confirmed on Obama’s inauguration day eight years ago. The Senate approved the nominees on what’s called a “voice vote,” not taking a formal tally. Those in favor simply holler “aye.” Those opposed shout “no.” The louder group prevails.
In 2009, the Senate confirmed Steven Chu as Energy secretary, Arne Duncan as Education secretary, Janet Napolitano as Homeland Security secretary, Ken Salazar as Interior secretary, Eric Shinseki as Veterans Affairs secretary, Tom Vilsack as Agriculture secretary and Peter Orszag as the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
The Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton as secretary of State the next day, 94-2 with 39 Republicans voting yea. Defense Secretary Bob Gates stayed on from the Bush administration.
At the very least, Republicans are angling to confirm Trump’s national security team Friday: Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., as CIA Director, retired Gen. James Mattis as Defense secretary and retired Gen. John Kelly as Homeland Security secretary. There’s chatter the Senate could confirm Elaine Chao, the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as Transportation secretary Friday. Chao’s not controversial. The Senate confirmed Chao on a voice vote as President George W. Bush’s Labor secretary in 2001.
This is an important moment for the Democrats. Democrats don’t align politically with many of the president-elect’s nominees. Cabinet confirmations are the first proxy fight on the field. Democrats must flex their muscles to build support with the left. This helps set the tone for the next two if not four years. The Democrats’ efforts to vilify the president and portray his choices in a negative light help their cause. In other words, if Trump is so good at spotting talent, why are there issues with the nominees?
“This is a swamp Cabinet full of bankers and billionaires,” proclaimed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
But doesn’t the president have the right to have as many members of his Cabinet in place as soon as possible? Schumer says “it’s not analogous” for the GOP to complain if the Senate doesn’t confirm seven nominees on inauguration day like they did for Obama. Schumer says the president’s nominees turned in their background paperwork for review in a timely fashion. He said the wealth of Trump’s picks created issues in the vetting process.
Start with Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson. Tillerson could even face Republican opposition. That’s a problem. Republicans hold a 52-48 advantage in the Senate (two independent senators caucus with the Democrats). If Democrats hold the line, Republicans have a narrow margin for error.
Democrats are also targeting Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos and EPA Administrator nominee Scott Pruitt. Democrats are worked into a lather over the nomination of Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., as Health and Human Services secretary. That’s because of the role Price could play in dismantling ObamaCare. The OMB nominee, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., just coughed up more than $15,000 in delayed payroll taxes he owed to a worker at his home.
“I’m sure they’ll grab for every straw they can to delay the president-elect’s cabinet,” said Cornyn.
But Democrats can’t do much to torpedo nominations if Republicans stick together. All Democrats can do is elongate the process by a day or two and require a procedural vote to end debate on a nomination. All eyes are watching for the first Republican senator who dares to vote against one of Trump’s nominees – and the wrath they may incur.
Such a prospect could give any senator indigestion – regardless of the wine pairing they preferred or the peanut crumble.

321,"Some 75 Girl Scouts said they wanted to participate in the organization’s tradition of being at the presidential inauguration.
But unlike any other time, they are coming under fire.
On social media and in essays published online, many women are denouncing the Girl Scouts of the USA for its plans to continue its tradition and take part in the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump on Friday.
The critics say that an organization like the Girl Scouts, which seeks to empower young females, should boycott Trump’s inauguration because of the scandals surrounding alleged sexual harassment by the president-elect years ago as well as an audio recording of him using salacious language to refer to women.
Some also cited Vice President-elect Mike Pence’s anti-abortion views as a reason that the Girl Scouts should skip the ceremonies.
But the Girl Scouts organization, which notes that it is non-political, says it will not make an exception to a tradition it has observed for decades, regardless of which party and which candidate wins the presidential election.
In a statement sent to FoxNews.com, the organization stressed that it is accommodating the desire of 75 girls from the Girl Scouts of Nation's Capital Council. The girls were among hundreds responding to a message posted in August on the council's website, well before the election. The council conducted surveys and selected the finalists.
We can no more turn our backs on 75 girls who have chosen to participate in the peaceful transition of power any more than we can on the thousands of girls participating in Women's Marches the next day. — Girl Scouts of the USA
“Being truly non-partisan means that we keep our focus on the girls. It means that we go where they lead,” the statement said. “It means we can no more turn our back on 75 girls who have chosen to participate in the peaceful transition of power any more than we can on the thousands of girls participating in Women’s Marches the next day.”
“The fact is, people often use Girl Scouts as an outlet to try to make a political statement,” it continued.
“We are girl-led and girl-driven, and our job, our mission, is to empower them to make their own choices, and express their own views.”
Some of the critics have been former Girl Scouts, such as Jean Hannah Edelstein, who made her objection known in an essay in The Guardian.
“The news that the Girl Scouts are sending a contingent to participate in Donald Trump’s inauguration filled me with real rage,” Edelstein wrote. “Yes, it’s a tradition: they’ve marched at inauguration for decades. But does tradition justify collaboration with an administration that promises to oppress the young women it’s supposed to serve?”
Many published reports noted that never before has the organization’s participation in the presidential election created such an outcry, even when other presidents, such as Bill Clinton, were trailed by scandals involving the treatment of women.
“Our legacy is one of uniting, not dividing, and our mission is fundamentally about bringing girls of all backgrounds together to discover their talents,” the organization said, “and unlock their leadership potential, so that they can lead all of us to the promise of a better day.”",neutral
322,"When president-elect Donald Trump addressed America after winning the election, he emphasized uniting the country. A new Fox News Poll suggests that could be a challenge.
In addition, President Obama leaves office on a high note. More on that later.
First, only one-third of voters describe the national mood as “we’re all in this together.” Nearly twice as many feel like it’s everyone for themselves. And half say they’re tired of politics and “want it to go away.”
CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS.
Voters also split over whether opportunities in the country favor “other people” or people like them.
Still, two-thirds feel optimistic about the economy (66 percent). In a rare instance of unity, majorities of independents (61 percent), Democrats (64 percent), and Republicans (72 percent) share this sunny outlook.
Who do voters credit for the recent rise in the stock market? More say Trump (23 percent) than outgoing President Obama (13 percent), but a 56-percent majority credits regular market cycles. Republicans (47 percent) are far more likely to credit Trump than Democrats are to credit Obama (26 percent).
When asked about the importance of several issues, voters put the economy as item number one on Trump’s to-do list.
Almost half say it is “extremely” important for him to focus on the economy/jobs in his first year (46 percent). Nearly as many say terrorism (44 percent) and health care (43 percent). Fewer give that same urgency to government spending (38 percent), foreign policy (34 percent), Supreme Court nominations (33 percent), and immigration (27 percent). Only 13 percent feel the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is extremely important.
A separate fill-in-the-blank question gave voters the chance to name whatever they thought should be Trump’s top priority. They could pick an issue, an action -- anything. Again, the economy comes in number one (25 percent). Health care (12 percent) and unite the country (12 percent) round out the top three.
By a 50-40 percent margin, voters say Trump’s doing a bad job of listening to people like them, and a 54-percent majority disapproves of how he’s handling the presidential transition. Thirty-seven percent approves, with the most enthusiasm coming from Republicans (73 percent), white evangelical Christians (64 percent), conservatives (63 percent), and whites without a college degree (52 percent).
Views on Trump as a person are similar, as 42 percent of voters have a favorable opinion (21 percent strongly), and 55 percent unfavorable (44 percent strongly). That’s a net negative of 13 points.
His two immediate predecessors had more appeal when they began their terms. When Barack Obama took office in January 2009, his rating was a net positive of 61 points (76 percent favorable, 15 percent unfavorable). George W. Bush had a net positive of 27 in January 2001 (58 percent favorable, 31 percent unfavorable).
What accounts for the difference? Some 27 percent of Democrats had a favorable view of Bush in 2001, and 55 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Obama in 2009. Today, only seven percent of Democrats have a positive opinion of Trump. Obama’s favorable rating among Republicans has dropped to 19 percent.
Vice president-elect Mike Pence’s rating is a net positive of eight points: 45 percent favorable vs. 37 percent unfavorable.
Meanwhile, by an 11-point margin, more men than women have a favorable opinion of Trump (48 vs. 37 percent), and men are also 12 points more likely than women to say the president-elect is doing a good job listening to people like them (46 vs. 34 percent).
That closely matches the gender gap in Trump’s election support, as men were 11 points more likely than women to vote for him (52-41 percent), according to the 2016 national Fox News exit poll. Women were 13 points more likely than men to vote for Hillary Clinton (54-41 percent).
President Obama
President Obama leaves office with positive job and personal ratings. Fifty-seven percent of voters approve of his job performance. That’s his highest since the summer of his first year in office (June 2009). Currently, 39 percent disapprove.
A record-high 95 percent of Democrats approve of Obama as he departs, as do 55 percent of independents, and 13 percent of Republicans. For comparison, the week he took office in January 2009, 85 percent of Democrats approved, as did 64 percent of independents, and 37 percent of Republicans.
By a 17-point margin (55-38 percent), voters think the country is better off today than before Obama became president. That’s a significant improvement from October 2014, when they said the country was worse off by 10 points (39 better off vs. 49 worse off).
The average job rating for Obama’s entire presidency tells the story: 47-47.
His highest approval, 65 percent, came the week after his 2009 inauguration. His lowest, 38 percent, came in September 2014, soon before Republicans re-took the U.S. Senate in the midterm election.
Obama’s been well-liked for much of his presidency, and that holds true today. The final read shows 60 percent have a favorable opinion of him (44 percent strongly). Thirty-nine percent have an unfavorable opinion (26 percent strongly).
That makes him more popular than George W. Bush (49 favorable, 46 unfavorable) and Bill Clinton (48 favorable, 46 unfavorable) were at the end of their terms.

Trump has been an outspoken critic of the price tag for projects like the F-35 fleet and the new Air Force One.
In December, Trump tweeted that he asked Boeing to “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet.” He did not go into specific details, but aviation experts pointed out differences in the two planes…for one, the F-18 is not stealth.

324,"President-elect Donald Trump will officially nominate former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue to be secretary of agriculture Thursday, a senior transition source told Fox News.
The nomination was expected to be announced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence during a press briefing with incoming White House Press secretary Sean Spicer Thursday morning.
Perdue, who in 2002 became the first Republican to be elected Georgia governor in 130 years, had long been considered the favorite to head the Agriculture Department in a Trump administration, with one source describing him to Fox News earlier this month as a ""lock"" for the position.
Perdue, 70, would be the first Southerner to lead the Agriculture Department in more than two decades. He comes from the small city of Bonaire in rural central Georgia, where he built businesses in grain trading and trucking. He is the cousin of Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga.
During Perdue's tenure as governor, Georgia adopted tough new food-safety regulations after a deadly U.S. salmonella outbreak was traced to Georgia-made peanut butter. He moved the state office that issues water permits for irrigation and other agricultural uses from Atlanta to rural south Georgia, where it would be closer to farmers. And Perdue poured millions of state dollars into Go Fish, a program that aimed to lure bass fishing tournaments to the state.
Perdue's nomination rounds out Trump's Cabinet choices. Sources told Fox News that the transition team wanted to complete the nominations by Friday.
Senate Republicans are pressing Democrats to allow confirmation votes for several of Trump's nominees on Friday evening, hours after he is inaugurated as the 45th president. Among those expected to be considered by the full Senate Friday are Defense Secretary nominee James Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary nominee John Kelly and Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., for CIA Director.

325,"Incoming President Donald Trump says he's dropped the idea of moving the daily White House briefing from the West Wing to accommodate the growing press corps.
“The press went crazy. So I said, ‘Let’s not move it.’ But some people in the press will not be able to get in because there’s just too many … for this small room,” Trump said in an interview with “Fox & Friends.”
Incoming Press Secretary Sean Spicer later confirmed the decision with Fox News that the briefings will, at least for now, remain in the James Brady briefing room.
The idea of relocating the daily briefing or perhaps moving the press corps to a larger work space started last week when Spicer suggested putting reporters in the White House Conference Center, near Lafayette Square. (Another proposed idea was moving the briefing to the adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building.)
Spicer then told “Fox News’ “Media Buzz” on Sunday that the proposed changes are in response to the “off the chart” demand to cover Trump.
The wealthy businessman and first-time candidate’s unexpected White House victory has become one of the most compelling stories in U.S. political history.
But Trump’s repeated argument that much of the mainstream media are dishonest and provide unfair coverage has led to concerns that he’ll deny access to some reporters and news media outlets.
Spicer said Sunday that thousands of reporters have sought White House credentials for a briefing room that has space for just 49 people and the proposed changes could “involve more people, be more transparent and (provide) more accessibility.”
But within hours of his comments, the White House Correspondents’ Association called for a meeting with Spicer to “get more clarity” on the proposals and ultimately vowed to “fight” limiting reporters’ access.
“The briefing room is open now to all reporters who request access,” said WHCA President Jeff Mason, a White House correspondent for Reuters. “We support that and always will. The WHCA will fight to keep the briefing room and West Wing access to senior administration officials open.”",negative
326,"EXCLUSIVE: President-elect Donald Trump told “Fox & Friends” co-host Ainsley Earhardt that he doesn't mind Democratic members of Congress boycotting his inauguration, saying ""I hope they give me their tickets.""
At least 60 Democratic members of the House of Representatives have opted to miss Friday's ceremonies, most notably Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who said last week that he did not consider Trump a ""legitimate"" president.
""I think he just grandstanded, John Lewis, and then he got caught in a very bad lie, so let’s see what happens,"" said Trump, referencing Lewis' initial claim that Trump’s would be the first inauguration he’s missed – despite having previously boycotted George W. Bush's 2001 inauguration.
Lewis’ office later claimed they had forgotten that incident, but Trump said: “You don’t forget something like that.”
Trump said he’d be willing to sit down with Lewis but added, “We’re off to a bad start.”
As for other lawmakers not attending, Trump said, “that’s OK, because we need seats so badly, I hope they give me their tickets.""
Trump spoke exclusively to Earhardt in an interview that aired Wednesday morning on ""Fox & Friends."" Earhardt joined ""Hannity"" Tuesday night to preview the sit-down.
""Immediately when I sat down, I said ‘How are you doing?’ because we’d been with him on the campaign trail for basically two years,"" Earhardt told Sean Hannity, ""and he said, ‘It’s been exhausting, it’s been hard because I’ve had to hire a lot of people.’""
Just days away from succeeding President Obama in the Oval Office, Trump discussed his plans for tackling a variety of issues, including his vow to repeal and replace ObamaCare at the same time.
Trump also addressed questions about whether his administration might move the location of the White House briefings – saying his team has since backed off those discussions, but warning that keeping the existing room will continue to cause space issues.
“The press went crazy, so I said, let’s not move it. But some people in the press will not be able to get in, because there’s just too many … for this small room,” Trump said.
The president-elect touched on his use of social media, which he says will continue after he is sworn in as the 45th president.

328,"Outside Brownsville, the 'wall' is made of rust-colored steel bars embedded in concrete. Elsewhere, it's a mix of steel and metal mesh.
In other spots across the southwest, it's nothing at all.
The southern border barrier that separates the U.S. from Mexico is in fact a mishmash of materials that stops and starts at various points across hundreds of miles. FoxNews.com visited one patchy section in southern Texas. Together, the inconsistencies show how big a task President-elect Donald Trump would be taking on if he pursues his ‘big, beautiful wall’ on the border.
Skeptics are hardly in short supply in this region.
In border city Brownsville, Democratic Mayor Tony Martinez is convinced a wall won’t work.
“It just boggles the mind,” he told FoxNews.com. “Why are we playing this charade? It’s a form of deception to the American people.”
CARTELS EXPLOIT BORDER WALL FEARS
Opinions in border communities like Del Rio, Laredo, Brownsville, Mission and McAllen are split. While almost everyone FoxNews.com spoke with said security needs to be beefed up, they question whether the wall is feasible.
Given the inconsistent barrier in place now, residents could be forgiven for having a hard time visualizing the kind of epic construction feat Trump wants to achieve.
The U.S.-Mexico border, all told, stretches more than 1,900 miles from the coast of California to the southern tip of Texas. Right now, 654 miles of that has fencing of some kind.
The kind of fence varies from location to location.
The El Paso sector, for example, uses “post-on-rail” steel set in concrete in some sections and a steel mesh fence in others. In San Diego, a bollard fence with cantilever – the kind used for federal buildings – is in place. In Yuma, it’s a metal mesh fence.
But the landscape along the south Texas border is diverse and unlike parts of New Mexico, Arizona, California, it zig-zags through the river, and cuts through people’s backyards, farmers’ fields and even the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley campus.
“It’s really a totally stupid thing,” Cameron County Sherriff Omar Lucio told FoxNews.com of the current set-up. “It’s 10 feet high and has huge openings.”
Lucio, who is responsible for protecting a large swath of south Texas, says some border crossers skip the wall altogether and use the mouth of the Rio Grande River to raft across from Matamoros, Mexico -- something a border wall might not be able to stop, either.
Illegal immigrants also can take advantage of other gaps in the wall along terrain too tough or expansive to patrol regularly.
“Most agents are in favor of some sort of wall or fence, although a wall alone won’t make the country safer,” Jon Anfinsen, president of Local 2366 of the National Border Patrol Council, told FoxNews.com. “There are other sectors that will simply not support a wall because of the terrain, so a wall has to be combined with new technology and additional manpower to make the country safer.”
Anfinsen says while other sectors could support a wall on most or all of its border in their areas, his is “too hilly to feasibly make a wall on its entire stretch of border.”
The border fence was authorized under the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. The legislation OK’d hundreds of miles of fencing along the Mexico border.
Since then, it’s been tweaked. Then-Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison pushed a measure that would give the Department of Homeland Security the authority to decide what type of fence should go up in different areas – the reason why there are so many different types of border barriers in place today.
As the border was being redrawn – in south Texas, it’s almost 2 miles north of the natural border of the Rio Grande River – people who had homes or businesses there paid the price.
Ray Loop’s family farm sits at the southernmost point along the border. Big, rusty 18-foot high steel bars courtesy of the federal government now dissect sections of it.
There are also gaps – lots of them, which border crossers use to make it over. Sometimes, they’ll hide in his citrus bushes waiting for the all clear. If that doesn’t work, they climb over on parts of the border that are lower.
“It takes them about a minute and a half to climb the wall,” he said.
Brownsville’s mayor showed FoxNews.com some of the holes in the wall. In one spot, the rust-colored bars end and a much shorter green fence begins. It’s easily traversable by migrant workers, asylum seekers, drug smugglers and human traffickers.
But Martinez says building a bigger, better wall like Trump has proposed won’t stop those determined to make it into U.S. territory.
Instead, he believes cross-border communication with Mexican authorities would go a long way toward cutting down on illegal immigration.
Cindy Johnson, a deaconess at United Methodist Women in Brownsville who works with illegal immigrants, agrees. As a lifelong resident of Brownsville, she urged Washington lawmakers against rushing to judgment on the benefits of a border wall.
“Lawmakers who’ve never even visited border communities shouldn’t be determining their futures,” Johnson told FoxNews.com.",neutral
329,"Donald Trump, on a war footing against the media, is now trying to discredit stories even before they air.
In a prebuttal on Twitter, he wrote that “@CNN, of all places, is doing a Special Report on my daughter, Ivanka. Considering it is CNN, can’t imagine it will be great!”
As Trump heads for Friday’s inauguration under a barrage of negative headlines, no president has ever taken office on such a war footing against the fourth estate. There’s a fascinating nugget in yesterday’s Washington Post poll about the tense relationship between the two sides.
(I should pause here for another Trump tweet: “The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before.” The Post poll echoes Gallup, Quinnipiac and CNN in saying Trump has a 40 percent approval rating, while the last four presidents-elect were in the 60s and 70s.)
But there’s an even split over the coverage of Trump, with 49 percent saying the media have treated him fairly and 47 percent unfairly.
When the question is reversed, however, 57 percent say Trump is treating the media unfairly, and 38 percent say fairly.
Leaving aside the sharp divide between Republicans and Democrats on this and other questions, the finding suggests that much of the public is turned off by his attacks on the “dishonest media.”
I don’t think this reflects any great love for the news business, whose credibility is at record lows. But it might indicate a sense that Trump should be more selective in his attacks, whether he’s beating up on the press or on those who attacked him first, from John Lewis to Meryl Streep.
But if the incoming president seems to be playing defense, let’s remember he’s in an environment in which 58 House Democrats are boycotting his inauguration. So much for the country coming together for the peaceful transfer of power, with hardly a disapproving note from the press.
At the same time, Trump is being hit with headlines like this: “As Trump Era Arrives, a Global Sense of Uncertainty.” (Fair enough to quote nervous foreign leaders, but it coincides with a largely sympathetic six-part series on President Obama, including an interview on the books he loves to read.)
Politico, in “Trump’s Divided State of America,” says since the election he has done more “to court Vladimir Putin than the 74 million Americans who voted for other presidential candidates—or the tens of millions who didn't vote at all.”. “Trump’s Presidency Is Doomed,” says Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen.
So when we evaluate Trump’s handling of the transition, it’s important to look at both sides. The man who vowed to drain the swamp is finding that plenty of swamp creatures are fighting back.
As for the president-elect’s tweet about CNN’s Ivanka Trump special, well, it went a bit awry. He used @Ivanka, the Twitter handle of a British digital consultant named Ivanka Majic, who responded: “May I suggest more care on Twitter and more time learning about #climate change.”",positive
330,"Both President George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush are now in a Houston hospital and will not attend Friday's inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.
The 92-year-old former president on Wednesday was moved to intensive care at Houston Methodist Hospital after being admitted on Saturday, his office said in a statement.
""Shortly after our previous report on President Bush’s condition, he was admitted to the ICU at Houston Methodist Hospital to address an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia,"" the statement read. ""Doctors performed a procedure to protect and clear his airway that required sedation. President Bush is stable and resting comfortably in the ICU, where he will remain for observation.""
Barbara Bush, 91, was admitted Wednesday morning as a precaution after experiencing fatigue and coughing, officials said in a statement.
The 41st president previously sent a letter to Donald Trump expressing his regrets he could not attend Friday's presidential inauguration, adding he and the former first lady ""will be with you and the country in spirit.""
In his letter -- penned Jan. 10, before he was hospitalized Saturday for breathing problems -- the former president quipped, ""My doctor says if I sit outside in January, it likely will put me six feet under.""
""So I guess we're stuck in Texas,"" wrote Bush. ""I want you to know that I wish you the very best as you begin this incredible journey of leading our great country,"" he wrote. ""If I can ever be of help, please let me know.""
Bush is the father of former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ran in a heated -- and, at times, contentious -- contest against Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.
Jeb Bush will not be attending the inauguration, but George W. and former first lady Laura Bush will be in attendance, as will Bill and Hillary Clinton.
The elder Bush, who served as U.S. president from 1989 to 1993, has a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a motorized scooter or a wheelchair for mobility. He was hospitalized in Maine in 2015 after falling at his summer home and breaking a bone in his neck, and was hospitalized in Houston the previous December for about a week for shortness of breath. He spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues.
Despite the loss of mobility, he celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump in Kennebunkport. Last summer, Bush led a group of 40 wounded warriors on a fishing trip at the helm of his speedboat, three days after his 92nd birthday celebration.

331,"Sen. John McCain said in an interview Wednesday that he is undecided about supporting President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson.
“I am very concerned about someone who took a friendship award from Vladimir Putin, who’s a butcher,” McCain told CBS. McCain called Putin a KGB agent and said “I’ve had concerns and I’ve had several conversations with him.”
Earlier this week, McCain told Fox News that he was leaning toward supporting the former ExxonMobil CEO. When pressed about his support, McCain said, “Barely, yes. I think [Tillerson] is a good man; I think he is aware of Vladimir Putin.”
The Wall Street Journal reported that three Republican senators have expressed concern over Tillerson. Sen. Marco Rubio is reportedly undecided on his vote and said he will not discuss the matter until he comes to a decision.
During the tense back-and-forths at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing last week, Rubio, R-Fla., cross-examined Tillerson on policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. At the end of Rubio's second questioning period, Tillerson sought to allay any concerns the aggressive Rubio may have had.
""There seems to be some misunderstanding that I see the world through a different lens, and I do not,"" Tillerson said. ""...But I'm also clear-eyed and realistic about dealing with cultures.""
Tillerson's statement followed a heated initial session during which the ExxonMobil CEO refused to specifically call Putin a ""war criminal.""

332,"More than a dozen states are asking a federal court to halt the Obama administration's latest rule affecting the coal industry before it goes into effect Thursday, the day before Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president.
Thirteen states petitioned a federal appeals court on Tuesday for an injunction halting the implementation of the Stream Protection Rule that was finalized by the Interior Department late last month. The rule seeks to prevent mining runoff from polluting streams and waterways.
Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is leading the court effort, said in a statement that the rule ""tramples states' retention of sovereign authority under the 10th Amendment and seeks to destroy an entire industry, displacing hardworking men and women and setting a precedent to disregard states' own understanding of major industries within their borders.""
The regulations are seen by the industry as too strict, leading to the prohibition of mining in many regions altogether. The rules require that the land near coal mines be virtually unchanged, which would make strip mining in states such as West Virginia more difficult, while requiring coal companies to conduct more testing and deploy new monitoring practices that will add costs.

333,"Donald Trump says his health care plan will provide “insurance for everybody.”
And that means we are about to find out what kind of Republican president he will be.
Trump’s comments to the Washington Post put him at odds with the Paul Ryan wing of the GOP, which has been waiting six years to junk Barack Obama’s signature program. And the incoming president doesn’t seem to care.
He says, in a classic Trumpism, that everyone will be “beautifully covered.”
Now I spent much of the campaign arguing that Trump, a onetime Democrat, was far from an orthodox Republican. This was clear when he repeatedly told me and other interviewers that he would not touch Medicare, despite the standard GOP position that soaring entitlement spending must be reined in. Trump appealed to working-class voters in part through a mixture of conservative and more moderate positions.
ObamaCare always contained a ticking time bomb for any future repeal effort. It’s a fact of Beltway life that it’s a zillion times harder to repeal an existing government benefit than to block a new one. With 20 million people added to the insurance rolls under the Affordable Care Act, the prospect of them losing coverage would be a PR nightmare for the Republicans.
At first the GOP seemed inclined to repeal now and promise to replace the program in a couple of years. But Trump insisted that both be done at the same time.
As for Trump’s insistence that no one lose medical insurance, here’s the warning shot: “I think we will get approval. I won’t tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what’s happened in the House in recent weeks.” That was an obvious reference to how he strong-armed the House GOP, with a single tweet, into reversing its ill-advised move to gut the congressional ethics office.
ObamaCare has lots of problems, including soaring premiums and all the people who lost their plans and access to their doctors, despite the president’s promises.
But when Trump said he wanted to keep two key elements—no ban on preexisting conditions and young people staying on parents’ policies until 26—it was clear the whole program wouldn’t be sent to the trash heap.
None of this means the Ryan Republicans won’t fight for their vision of a stripped-down vehicle, perhaps with individual health savings accounts. And Trump may learn that delivering “lower premiums,” as he told the Post, is complicated in a program with so many interlocking parts. He also said he would pressure drug companies to reduce prices, as he is doing with Boeing and the cost of the next Air Force One planes.
Whether Trump can bring a better health care program in for a landing—or it gets mired in Capitol Hill quicksand—will be an early test of whether he can turn campaign rhetoric into reality.",negative
334,"President-elect Donald Trump is expected to meet with the head of Boeing Tuesday to discuss the contract to update the next Air Force One, The Seattle Times reported, citing a person familiar with the plans.
Last month, Boeing’s Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump and told him that his company can build a new Air Force One for less than originally quoted. Trump made headlines for blasting the company on Twitter for alleged cost overruns and called on the government to cancel the contract.
The paper reported that it is unclear what the two will discuss at the meeting. Muilenburg has appeared to strike an agreeable tone with the incoming president and said he made a “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing company.”
Since early December, Trump has been browbeating Boeing and Lockheed Martin over the costs of the next Air Force One and the F-35, respectively.

335,"President-elect Donald Trump renewed his feud with Democratic Rep. John Lewis on Tuesday, accusing the Georgia congressman of misrepresenting the facts about his plans to boycott Trump's inauguration.
After a weekend of nasty sparring between the two politicians that was put on pause for MLK Day, Trump drew attention on Twitter to Lewis' questionable claim he's never missed a swearing-in.
“John Lewis said about my inauguration, ‘it will be the first one that I’ve missed.’ WRONG (or lie)! He boycotted Bush 43 also because he ‘thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in….he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.” Sound familiar! WP,” Trump wrote.
The ‘WP’ appeared to be shorthand for The Washington Post, which published on Jan. 21, 2001, a story about Lewis skipping George W. Bush’s inaugural. The article records Lewis as spending Bush’s inauguration day in his Atlanta district.
CONWAY: LEWIS' COMMENTS ON TRUMP WERE 'DISAPPOINTING'
Yet Lewis, during the same “Meet The Press” interview in which he asserted Trump is not a “legitimate president,” also had claimed Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration would “be the first one that I miss since I’ve been in Congress.”
“You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right,” Lewis said.
Lewis' staff tried to clarify later Tuesday, saying the congressman forgot about the 2001 protest.
""That was almost 20 years ago,"" a spokesman told The Washington Post.
Lewis’ issue with Trump’s legitimacy appears to center around alleged Russian interference in the political process during the run-up to the election. The Bush boycott occurred after Bush’s protracted dispute about Florida’s ballots with Democratic nominee Al Gore. In both cases, the Republican candidates – Trump and Bush – won the Electoral College vote while the Democratic candidates – Hillary Clinton and Gore – won the popular vote.
Trump responded quickly to Lewis on Sunday, tweeting that Lewis “should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk – no action or results. Sad!”
Trump was excoriated by many on social media and television for his disparagement of Lewis, who was an icon during the civil rights struggle. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, Trump met with the late leader’s son, Martin Luther King III, who attempted to interject a note of calm.

At least two so-called ""landing teams"" in Cabinet agencies have relayed the call for cuts as part of their marching orders to shrink the flab in government.
The cuts would target discretionary spending, not mandated programs such as Medicare or Social Security, the sources said.

337,"Education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos voiced strong support for public school alternatives at her confirmation hearing Tuesday, telling senators that ""parents no longer believe that a one-size-fits-all model of learning fits the needs of every child.""
DeVos told the Senate Health, Education and Pensions Committe that she would be ""a strong advocate for great public schools"" if confirmed, but added that ""if a school is troubled, or unsafe, or not a good fit for a child ... we should support a parent's right to enroll their child in a high-quality alternative.""
DeVos, 59, also said she will seek to address rising higher education costs and massive student debt, but also advance trade and vocational schools as well as community colleges because ""craftsmanship is not a fallback — but a noble pursuit.""
President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of DeVos to lead the Department of Education was harshly criticized by teacher's unions, who have claimed that DeVos wants to undermine the public education system, which provides instruction to more than 90 percent of the country's students.
In his opening statement, committee chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., himself a former secretary of education, said DeVos is ""on our children's side.""
""I believe she is in the mainstream of public opinion, and her critics are not,"" said Alexander. That praise was echoed by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who introduced DeVos to the committee by calling her ""a champion of education, and specifically a champion of education for poor kids.""
Former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman also appeared before his onetime colleagues to introduce DeVos.
""We just can't accept the status quo in education anymore,"" Lieberman said. ""We need a change agent and an education reformer to be education secretary ... and that is exactly the kind of education secretary I believe Betsy DeVos can and will be.""
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the committee's ranking member, expressed concern that lawmakers had not received an ethics review for the nominee.
""I am extremely disappointed that we are moving forward with this hearing without receiving the proper paperwork from the Office of Goverment Ethics,"" Murray said.
Murray also told DeVos that federal policy should be focused on strengthening public schools, ""and certainly not toward diverting taxpayer dollars to fund vouchers that don't work for unaccountable private schools."" She asked DeVos point-blank to pledge that she would not seek to privatize public schools or take money away from them.
DeVos, whose husband is the heir to the Amway marketing fortune, has for decades used the family’s influence and wealth in her home state of Michigan to advocate for charter schools and promote conservative religious values. Critics of DeVos have expressed concerns about her financial contributions and possible conflicts of interest.
The nominee attempted to assuage those concerns during the question-and answer period, pledging that she ""will not be conflicted. Period."" DeVos also said that she will take a government salary of $1 if confirmed.
Asked outright by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., if she got the job because of her family's political contributions, DeVos said: ""As a matter of fact I do think that there would be that possibility. I have worked very hard on behalf of parents and children for the last almost 30 years.""
On tuition-free public colleges and universities, DeVos said: ""I think we also have to consider the fact that there is nothing in life that is truly free. Somebody is going to pay for it.""
She skirted Sanders' question on whether she would support making child care free or much more affordable for low-income families as is the case in many countries around the world, saying only that she feels strongly about ""parents having an opportunities for child care for their children.""
""But it's not a question of opportunity,"" Sanders fired back, raising his voice. ""It's a question of being able to afford it!""
As the hearing dragged on into its fourth hour, Democratic senators made repeated requests with Chairman Alexander to allow them to pose another round of questions to DeVos, but he refused, citing procedures at previous hearings.
DeVos is expected to get enough votes in the committee and before the full Senate to be confirmed, considering she needs only a simple majority, with Republicans having 52 senators and Democrats having 48.
In a letter addressed to the committee, 38 prominent education groups and teachers' organizations expressed concern that DeVos' track record bodes ill for public education.
""Over the course of her career as a major campaign contributor, soft-money donor and lobbyist, DeVos has used her considerable wealth to influence legislation and the outcomes of elections to advance policies that have undermined public education and proved harmful to many of our most vulnerable students,"" the letter said.
LGBT groups also have protested Trump's choice of DeVos, saying she has funded conservative religious groups that promote what they consider to be traditional family values, including one organization that supports conversion therapy -- counseling of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people with the aim of changing their sexual orientation.
DeVos repeatedly disavowed any support for conversion therapy Tuesday, saying in her opening statement that ""every child in America deserves to be in a safe environment that is free from discrimination.""
Under questioning from Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., DeVos said that ""I have never believed in"" conversion therapy and ""I believe in the innate value of every single human being."" Alexander later read into the record a letter of support from the Log Cabin Republicans, a Republican organization pushing for LGBT rights.
DeVos supporters, meanwhile, applauded her nomination. Eva Moskowitz, CEO of Success Academy Charter Schools, said that American public education ""is in deep crisis,"" with 35 countries outranking American schools in math and 20 in reading.
""I believe Betsy DeVos has the talent, commitment and leadership capacity to revitalize our public schools and deliver the promise of opportunity that excellent education provides, and I support her nomination as U.S. secretary of education,"" Moskowitz said in a statement.
DeVos has also garnered strong backing from two dozen state governors, as well as another former education secretary, William Bennett.

339,"President-elect Donald Trump criticized a cornerstone of House Republicans’ corporate-tax plan, which they had pitched as an alternative to his proposed import tariffs, creating another point of contention between the incoming president and congressional allies.
The measure, known as border adjustment, would tax imports and exempt exports as part of a broader plan to encourage companies to locate jobs and production in the U.S. But Mr. Trump, in his first comments on the subject, called it “too complicated.”
“Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Friday. “Because usually it means we’re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. That’s what happens.”
Retailers and oil refiners have lined up against the measure, warning it would drive up their tax bills and force them to raise prices because they rely so heavily on imported goods.
Koch Industries, a conglomerate run by billionaire brothers active in Republican politics, last month said the border-adjustment measure could have “devastating” long-term consequences for the economy and the American consumer.
Independent analyses of the Republican tax plan say it would lead the dollar to appreciate further—which would lower the cost of imported goods, offsetting the effects of the tax on retailers and others.
In his interview with the Journal on Friday, Mr. Trump said the U.S. dollar was already “too strong” in part because China holds down its currency, the yuan. “Our companies can’t compete with them now because our currency is too strong. And it’s killing us.”

340,"President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday cast doubt on polls showing low approval ratings ahead of Inauguration Day, calling them “phony” and the pollsters “wrong” like they were about his election numbers.
“The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls,” Trump tweeted. “They are rigged just like before.”
Trump, who is sworn-in on Friday, responded within hours of three polls -- Monmouth University, ABC News/ Washington Post and CNN/ORG -- being released.
The ABC and CNN polls each showed slightly more than 50 percent of Americans having an unfavorable view of Trump, while the Monmouth poll number was at 46 percent.
A poll released Monday and one released last week also gave the Republican low marks on his transition from White House winner to president.
But some experts and supporters disagree, or at least urge Americans to wait before submitting a final grade.
“The transition is a means to an end, not an end itself,” says Max Stier, of the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition. “So far, I’d give him an incomplete. Ask me again in three months.”
Stier argues that Trump, or any U.S. president, needs about a year before their transition effort comes into full view.
Some of Trump’s early challenges, or problems, may be inherent or self-inflicted -- including his continuing strategy of eviscerating critics on Twitter.
Trump has also faced criticism about picking people to lead his transition team and administration who lack Executive Branch experience.
“It’s critical to have people in place who fully understand the machine,” Stier said.
Another issue hurting Trump is critics’ questions about some of his Cabinet picks’ long-standing business ties or views considered beyond the mainstream.
Joe Desilets, a Republican strategist and a member of Trump’s Pennsylvania campaign team, argued that Trump and his transition team have been “incredibly successful” on several fronts, including successful effort to keep or bring back jobs to the United States.
“The Cabinet that President-elect Trump has assembled is a long list of incredible leaders from industry, politics and the military,” Desilets said. “Most importantly, Trump is putting together the team that he needs to enact the agenda and policies that he put forward to the American people during his campaign.”",neutral

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said during a news conference Tuesday that Moscow was encouraged by President-elect Donald Trump’s focus on combating terrorism.
He voiced hope that Russian and U.S. experts could start discussions on fighting terrorism in Syria, in Kazakhstan's capital when Syrian government and opposition representatives meet for talks.
“We hope that the new administration will be able to accept that proposal,"" adding that the talks in Astana will offer ""the first opportunity to discuss a more efficient fight against terrorism in Syria,” Lavrov added.
Lavrov said that Russia expects that cooperation on settling the Syrian crisis will be more productive than it was with the Obama administration.
RUSSIAN FM SAYS ALLEGATIONS OF CYBERATTACKS ON US ARE FABRICATED
Representatives from some Syrian rebel groups said Monday they would attend talks sponsored by Russia and Turkey, despite mounting violations of a fragile ceasefire across the war-torn country.
Opposition activists have reported widespread violence around Syria. Although the scale of the violence was not comparable to the government-led, Russian-backed offensive against Aleppo that preceded the cease-fire, airstrikes and shelling were reported in at least eight of Syria's 14 provinces Monday.
The ceasefire excludes areas where the Islamic State operates. There, too, fighting raged as militants closed in on a government military base while Turkey-backed and Kurdish-backed fighters clashed with the extremist group in three provinces.
The talks are considered a diplomatic feat for Moscow. After withstanding a crippling, months-long siege and punishing bombing campaign, the opposition surrendered one of its most prized urban centers, Aleppo. Rebel groups had control of nearly half of the city, once Syria's commercial center, since 2012.
The United States was left out of the ceasefire agreement, which was finalized on Dec. 30.

343,"In a speech that one-upped even some of the president-elect’s colorful Twitter commentary, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday called Donald Trump’s political enemies “worse than prostitutes” for disseminating a dubiously-sourced dossier last week alleging a relationship between Trump and the Kremlin.
Speaking during a news conference, Putin said last week’s leak of the 35-page report -- written by a private investigator as a series of memos and eventually passed on to the intelligence community -- was a last-ditch attempt on the part of President Obama’s outgoing administration to “undermine the legitimacy of the president-elect.”
“Prostitution is an ugly social phenomenon . . . but people who order such fakes, which are now used against the elected president of the United States, fabricate information and use it in the political struggle, they are worse than prostitutes,” Putin said, according to a translation by Sputnik News. “They have no moral limits.”
TRUMP PRAISES PUTIN OVER RESPONSE TO US SANCTIONS
The series of memos alleged that Russian intelligence had years ago secretly recorded embarrassing footage of Trump in an attempt to compromise the then-business magnate. Putin dismissed that claim as “an obvious fake.”
“Trump, when he came to Moscow a few years ago, was not a politician,” Putin said. “We did not even know about his political ambitions,” Putin said. “He was just a businessman, one of the richest men in America. Is someone really thinking that our intelligence agencies are chasing every American billionaire, or what? Of course not. It’s just a complete nonsense.”
Putin added: ""I find it hard to believe that he rushed to some hotel to meet girls of loose morals, although ours are undoubtedly the best in the world.”
He said some seem “ready to organize a ‘Maidan’ in Washington,"" in reference to the alleged U.S. role in organizing protests in the main square of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev. That action helped chase the nation's Russia-friendly president from power in 2014.
Putin cited two goals he believed were behind the leaking of the allegations: (1) to undermine Trump’s “legitimacy” and (2) “to tie the hands and legs of the newly-elected president related to the implementation of his pre-election campaign promises to the American people and the international community.”
PUTIN REACHES OUT TO TRUMP WHILE THUMPING DEMS
Trump on Twitter has openly questioned if the intelligence community was behind leaking the memos to the press. BuzzFeed released the documents in bulk last week despite the site’s own disclaimer that much of the information could not be verified.
Trump has faced increasing criticism from many on the political left and some on the right for his perceived friendly relationship with Russia -- and Putin, in particular. While many of his Cabinet selections -- including Secretary of Defense nominee Gen. James Mattis and Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson – have taken a harder line toward the Kremlin, Trump has been complimentary of Putin and openly professed a desire to restore better relations between the U.S. and Russia. Putin has returned the praise and expressed his own wishes to work with Trump after he takes office Friday.
The intelligence community last month released a thinly-sourced unclassified document alleging that Russia was behind a series of hacks and cyber tricks designed to undermine America's confidence in the electoral process. There was no evidence, however, that Russia altered any votes or hacked into any voting software. In response, the Obama administration ejected 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S., among other actions.
Russia has denied all charges.

344,"As more Democrats get on the bandwagon of boycotting President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, one lawmaker – Rep. Maxine Waters – took the opposition a big step further Monday and floated the possibility of impeachment.
Waters, D-Calif., is one of at least 53 Democratic lawmakers pledging to boycott the Jan. 20 inauguration, joining Rep. John Lewis and others after he declared Trump an illegitimate president in light of alleged Russian interference in the election.
However, Waters took that charge to the next level in an interview on MSNBC’s “Hardball,” saying if some form of collusion were found between the Russians and the Trump campaign, the question of Trump’s impeachment should be raised.
“If we discover that Donald Trump or his advocates played a role in helping to devise strategy, if they are the ones who came up with 'Crooked Hillary,' if they are the ones who came up with 'she's ill,' 'something's wrong with her energy,' and the way that he basically described her in the campaign, I think that is something that would put the question squarely on the table whether or not he should be impeached,” she said.
Asked by MSNBC host Chris Matthews whether Trump could have committed an impeachable offense before even taking office, Waters doubled down and called for more investigations.
“Well I think at the point that investigations discover and can confirm and document any of that that they had a role in helping to strategize, they had a role in attempting to determine the outcome that in many ways they used the information that they got from DNC when they hacked into our e-mails, etc., if that was used against Hillary Clinton in some ways, yes, I think that's impeachable,” she said.
While Waters and Lewis have been among the most vocal in their opposition to Trump, it's not the first time they've pre-emptively protested an incoming president.
The last time a GOP president was elected – George W. Bush in 2000 – Lewis and Waters both refused to attend his inauguration, with Lewis citing questions surrounding the election. A 2001 Washington Post article reported that Lewis chose not to attend as he “doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.”
Trump noted Lewis’ past boycott Tuesday morning, calling him out for remarks he made on NBC’s ""Meet The Press"" on Sunday in which Lewis claimed, incorrectly, this is the first inauguration he will miss.",positive
345,"Donald Trump's choice to head the Interior Department on Tuesday rejected the president-elect's claim that climate change is a hoax, saying it is indisputable that environmental changes are affecting the world's temperature and human activity is a major reason.
""I don't believe it's a hoax,"" Rep. Ryan Zinke told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at his confirmation hearing.
""The climate is changing. The debate is what is that influence and what can we do,"" said the Montana Republican.
Trump has suggested in recent weeks he's keeping an open mind on the issue and may reconsider a campaign pledge to back away from a 2015 Paris agreement that calls for global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
In contradicting Trump, Zinke cited Glacier National Park in his home state as a prime example of the effects of climate change, noting that glaciers there have receded in his lifetime and even from one visit to the next.
Still, he told Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that there is debate about how much humans have influenced the climate.
Likely to win Senate confirmation, Zinke sketched out a variety of purposes for the nation's vast federal lands, from hiking, hunting, fishing and camping to harvesting timber and mining for coal and other energy sources.
An admirer of President Theodore Roosevelt, Zinke said management of federal lands should be done under a ""multiple-use"" model set forth by Gifford Pinchot, a longtime Roosevelt associate and the first chief of the U.S. Forest Service.
Zinke also pledged to tackle an estimated $12 billion backlog in maintenance and repair at national parks, saying parks and other public lands should be a key part of Trump's infrastructure improvement plan.
Zinke has said he would never sell, give away or transfer public lands -- a crucial stance in his home state of Montana and the rest of the West where access to hunting and fishing is considered sacrosanct.
Zinke feels so strongly that he resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention last summer because of the GOP's position in favor of land transfers to state or private groups. But Zinke's commitment to public lands has come into question in recent weeks.
The Interior Department and other U.S. agencies control almost a third of land in the West and even more of the underground ""mineral estate"" that holds vast amounts of coal, oil and natural gas.
Zinke's position on public lands came under fire after he voted in favor of a measure from House Republicans that would allow federal land transfers to be considered cost-free and budget-neutral, making it easier for drilling and development.
Zinke ""says he's against transfer of federal lands, but there's a big gap between what he says and what he does in that regard,"" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation's oldest and largest environmental group.
Zinke told senators Tuesday that he flatly opposes all sales or transfer of federal lands.
Indeed, his support for public lands was a crucial reason why Zinke was chosen by Trump. The president-elect and son Donald Trump Jr. both oppose sale of federal lands. The younger Trump, an avid hunter, has taken a keen interest in Interior Department issues and played a key role in Zinke's selection.
Zinke also reiterated his support for coal production on federal lands as part of an all-of-the above energy strategy
Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the top Democrat on the energy panel, asked Zinke about modernizing the federal coal program, saying it was important ""to make sure American taxpayers aren't short-changed for the benefit of corporate interests
Zinke promised to review the coal program and said he thinks taxpayers ""should always get fair value,"" whether it's coal, wind power or other energy sources.",negative
346,"John Brennan, the outgoing Central Intelligence Agency director, rejected President-elect Donald Trump’s suggestion that he may have leaked the unsubstantiated dossier that claimed Russia had compromising allegations about Trump.
“First of all, this is not intelligence community information,” Brennan said Monday. Brennan said he did not read the document and, according to the Wall Street Journal, gave it no particular credence.
Trump blasted outgoing director on social media Sunday after Brennan said Trump does not have a “full understanding” of Russia’s power and threat to the world.
“I don’t think he has a full understanding of Russian capabilities and the actions they are taking on the world,” Brennan told “Fox News Sunday.”
He also suggested that Trump lacks a “full appreciation” of Russia’s aggression or about why President Obama imposed sanctions on the Kremlin for meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
“Mr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia is a road that he needs to be very, very careful about moving down,” Brennan said.
Trump responded with a two-tweet message that criticized the CIA's record under Brennan and questioned whether the director had leaked a dossier of unverified allegations that Russia spies had obtained compromising personal and financial information about Trump.
TRANSITION OF POWER
The day after the dossier's contents were published by BuzzFeed, Trump posted on Twitter that intelligence agencies ""should never have allowed this fake news to 'leak'"" before asking ""Are we living in Nazi Germany?""
Brennan was reportedly indignant that Trump attacked his fellow spies, according to The Journal. He mentioned Trumps tweet on Nazi Germany in particular.
“Tell the families of those 117 CIA officers who are forever memorialized on our wall of honor that their loved ones who gave their lives were akin to Nazis,” Brennan said. “Tell the CIA officers who are serving in harm’s way right now and their families who are worried about them that they are akin to Nazi Germany. I found that to be very repugnant, and I will forever stand up for the integrity and patriotism of my officers who have done much over the years to sacrifice for their fellow citizens.”",negative

“It was an awesome experience,” Sgt. Maj. Greg Lowery said.
Lowery and Spc. Sara Corry got the chance to play the part of President-elect Donald Trump and incoming first lady Melania, respectively, on Sunday in a start-to-finish dress rehearsal in Washington. They described the once-in-a-lifetime experience, in a joint interview Tuesday morning on “Fox & Friends.”
“I was really honored to be able to see it and have a bird’s eye view of what the president will see on Friday,” Corry said. She said it was her first time at the Capitol, calling it “incredible.”
Lowery said the two of them went through an interview process to get the gig.
The criteria were straightforward: “We were selected based on our height, general appearance.”
But he played the part.
One widely circulated photo shows Lowery flashing a very-Trumpian thumbs-up to the “crowd.”
“It felt right in the moment,” he said.
Since the pictures have made the rounds, Lowery said he’s heard from friends he hasn’t connected with in years, and his Facebook page has “blown up.”
The real Trumps, meanwhile, are making additional preparations for the main event Friday. Fox News can confirm that Trump has done a practice run of his inaugural address with a TelePrompter and podium in New York City, and there will be an underlying theme of “America first.”
Trump also plans to use two Bibles for the swearing-in with Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts: One family Bible and the Lincoln Bible.
So do the Trump “stand-ins” have any advice for the soon-to-be first family?
Recalling some trouble he had on the final step leading to the podium, Lowery said:

348,"President-elect Donald Trump vowed over the weekend to quickly work out a trade deal with Britain in a bid to help smooth the country's path out of the European Union -- further strengthening ties with the Brexit movement he lauded during his campaign.
At the same time, in an interview with The Times of London published Sunday, Trump also riled European leaders by dismissing the E.U. as a “vehicle for Germany.”
Trump ripped German Chancellor Angela Merkel over her decision to welcome more than a million Syrian refugees into her country. While Trump said he had great respect for Merkel, he accused her of making “a catastrophic mistake,” which triggered Brexit.
“[I]f they [EU countries] hadn’t been forced to take in all of the refugees, so many, with all the problems that it … entails, I think that you wouldn’t have a Brexit,"" he said.
Trump used the interview to again endorse the Brexit decision to leave the E.U., saying he was a ""big fan"" of the U.K.
Amid widespread questions over how the U.K. will re-establish trade ties with international partners once it leaves, Trump vowed to work out a U.S.-U.K. agreement soon: ""We’re gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly. Good for both sides.""
Trump's remarks stand in contrast to President Obama's warning before the June vote that Britain would be at the “back of the queue” for a trade deal if it voted to leave.
The president-elect also showed indifference to the E.U. as a whole: “You look at the European Union and it’s Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That’s why I thought the U.K. was so smart in getting out.”
Trump has spoken positively of the Brexit decision in the past, and repeatedly compared it to his own populist campaign. But his latest remarks, in which he predicted “Brexit is going to end up being a great thing,” along with the promise of a trade deal, were greeted with particular enthusiasm by pro-Brexit politicians.
""It's very good news that the United States of America wants to do a good free trade deal with us and wants to do it very fast and it's great to hear that from President-elect Donald Trump,"" U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told reporters Monday in Brussels.
“I was delighted to hear Mr. Trump speak so positively about Brexit,” U.K. Independence Party MP Douglas Carswell told FoxNews.com. “It means so much to me -- and to the millions of Brits who voted to leave the EU. It is good to know that our American ally will help us make it work.”
Trump’s remarks come as Prime Minister Theresa May is set to make a major speech on the subject Tuesday, in which she is expected to call for a so-called “hard Brexit” -- in which Britain will also leave the E.U.’s single market and customs union in order to assure control over Britain’s borders.
Carswell, whose party was instrumental in the campaign to leave the E.U., said that Trump’s comments are likely to have a significant impact in breaking down the fierce European opposition to Brexit.
“If there is a U.S./U.K. trade deal based on mutual standard recognition, far from the EU trying to impose protectionist barriers on us, they might even actually ask if they too could be part of something similar,” he said.
Trump also said some NATO partners aren’t paying enough into the alliance, and repeated his past accusation that the alliance is “obsolete.”
""With that being said, NATO is very important to me. There’s five countries that are paying what they’re supposed to. Five. It’s not much,” he said.
Trump’s comments on Europe immediately drew criticism from European politicians. Merkel said, ""I think we Europeans have our fate in our own hands” when asked about Trump’s comments Monday morning.
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Trump’s NATO comments had “caused astonishment” both in Brussels and with NATO leaders.
“First, it goes against the statements of the nominated defense secretary a few days ago. We have to see what it will yield in terms of U.S. foreign policy. The same goes for the statements on trade policy,” he said, according to the Wall Street Journal. “We count on the U.S. to stick to its international obligations, including in the World Trade Organization.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called on European leaders to remain united.
“As is the case with Brexit, the best way of defending Europe, which is rather what Mr. Trump has invited us to do, is to remain united, to remain as a bloc, not to forget that the strength of the Europeans lies in their unity,” he said, according to the Journal.
However, Carswell indicated there may be some support for Trump’s stances in Britain.
“Europe needs to start meeting its responsibilities as part of the wider West -- and post-Brexit Britain can be part of making that happen,” he said.
In the wide-ranging interview, Trump also expressed hope that the U.S. can “make some good deals” with Russia, including reducing nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of U.S. sanctions.",negative

Trump declined to reveal the pertinent details of the new health care plan, but told The Post in the interview published Sunday night that drug companies will be forced to negotiate on Medicare and Medicaid prices. He also plans to fight pharmaceutical companies over drug prices.
The president-elect insisted that his plan for replacing the Affordable Healthcare Act is all but finished, and added that care would have “lower numbers, much lower deductibles.” He went as far to say that he’s ready to reveal it alongside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan.
“It’s very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven’t put it in quite yet, but we’re going to be doing it soon,” Trump said during the interview with the paper.

PAUL PREVIEWS OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT PLAN FOCUSING ON LOWER COST POLICIES
Congressional Republicans took the first big step last week in their seven-year trek to dismantle President Obama’s health care law, passing a budget that would ease the passage of a bill that would replace ObamaCare. The budget — the Senate approved it Thursday — bars Democratic senators from blocking that future legislation with a filibuster.
The budget ""gives us the tools we need for a step-by-step approach to fix these problems and put Americans back in control of their health care,"" Ryan, R-Wis., said after the vote.
Though Trump wants a quick repeal and replace of the law, there’s likely to be months of debate and infighting before the new law could be passed. Much of Friday's debate underscored the sharp-elbowed politics of the issue.
""People in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio -- screwed,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., citing places where he said voters would suffer from the health law's repeal — which also were normally reliably Democratic states that Trump won on Election Day. Continuing the theme of highlighting Trump voters, Jeffries added, ""People in Appalachia and rural America -- screwed.""
Democrats praised the law for extending coverage to tens of millions of Americans and helping many millions more afford policies and buy prescriptions. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., said rather than ""repeal and replace,"" Republicans should name their effort ""repeal and repent"" because of the harm they were about to cause to voters.
No. 3 House GOP leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana aimed his rhetoric at Democrats defending one of Obama's proudest legislative achievements, a law that Republicans say missed its goals of cutting consumers' medical costs and increasing access to doctors.
""This should not be about preserving somebody's legacy,"" Scalise said. ""It should be about fulfilling those promises to the American people that were broken.""
THOUSANDS ATTEND US RALLIES TO SUPPORT OBAMA HEALTH LAW
Approval of the budget means Senate Democrats won't be allowed to filibuster the future repeal-and-replace bill — a pivotal advantage for Republicans. They control the Senate 52-48, but it takes 60 votes to end filibusters, which are endless procedural delays that can scuttle legislation.
Congressional Republicans have made annulling Obama's law and replacing it a top goal for the past seven years. GOP rifts and an Obama veto prevented them from achieving anything other than holding scores of votes that served as political messaging.
Trump insists that the new law will be better despite worries from Congress and the possibility of putting 20 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage.
“We’re going to have insurance for everybody. There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.”

351,"President-elect Donald Trump said Friday that one of the key parts of the House Republicans’ corporate-tax plan that would tax imports and exempt exports was “too complicated.""
“Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” he told The Wall Street Journal. “Because usually it means we’re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. That’s what happens.”
The border adjustment tax plan is one of the most controversial parts of the House Republicans’ tax plan. The measure is reportedly part of a broader plan to encourage companies to locate jobs and production in the U.S.
TRANSITION TO TRUMP
“If you take out the border adjustment, you have to really think about an entirely different reform,” Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, a conservative leaning group in Washington, told the paper.
Foreign companies that import goods to the U.S. would have to pay the tax, increasing the cost of imports. Exporters love the idea. But importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say it could lead to steep price increases on consumer goods. The lobbying has already begun.
Koch Industries Inc., said last month that the measure could be “devastating” for the economy. The Journal, citing independent analyses, said the tax plan would lead the dollar to appreciate, which would offset the cost for retailers.
Under current law, the United States taxes the profits of U.S.-based companies, even if the money is made overseas. However, taxes on foreign income are deferred until a company either reinvests the profits in the U.S. or distributes them to shareholders.
Critics say the system encourages U.S.-based corporations to invest profits overseas or, more dramatically, to shift operations and jobs abroad to avoid U.S. taxes.
House Republicans want to scrap America's worldwide tax system and replace it with a tax that is based on where a firm's products are consumed, rather than where they are produced.

352,"The increase of Israeli settlements has ""gotten so substantial"" that it is inhibiting the possibility for an ""effective, contiguous Palestinian state,"" President Barack Obama said Sunday, in his final interview as president.
Speaking to CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" Obama dismissed the idea that there is a ""major rupture"" in the relationship between the United States and Israel after last month's decision by the U.S. to abstain from a United Nations vote condemning Israeli settlements.
""Because of our investment in the region, and because we care so deeply about Israel, I think (the U.S.) has a legitimate interest in saying to a friend, 'This is a problem,'"" Obama said. ""It would have long-term consequences for peace and security in the region, and the United States.""
The outgoing president reflected on his legacy and his biggest challenges during his eight years in office during the hourlong interview. A number of his policies — from health care to his contentious relationship with Israel — could be short-lived as President-elect Donald Trump becomes the 45th president later this week and vows to reverse some of those policies.
Trump has been vocal about his disapproval of many of Obama's policies, often voicing his disagreement or engaging in public disputes with the president on Twitter. Most recently, Trump lashed out over hypothetical comments Obama made that he would beat Trump if they ran against each other in a general election.
Over the holidays, Trump accused Obama of throwing up ""inflammatory"" roadblocks during the transition of power and his administration of treating Israel with ""total disdain.""
Obama acknowledged it's been an ""unusual"" transition, adding, ""I suspect the president-elect would agree with that.""
""We are moving into an era where a lot of people get their information through tweets and soundbites and some headline that comes over their phone,"" the president said. ""There's a power in that. There's also a danger — what generates a headline or stirs up a controversy and gets attention isn't the same as the process required to actually solve the problem.""
He warned people not to ""underestimate the guy"" and urged congressional Republicans and Trump supporters around the country to be sure ""that as we go forward, certain norms, certain institutional traditions don't get eroded, because there's a reason they're in place.""
Obama said there needs to be a focus on ""making sure that our democracy stays healthy, and making sure that we maintain that sense of solidarity.""
With that, he said he's been ""disturbed"" about intelligence reports over Russia hacking the U.S. election.
""I have been concerned about the degree to which, in some circles, you've seen people suggest that Vladimir Putin has more credibility than the U.S. government,"" he said. ""You're not going to be able to make good decisions without building some relationship of trust between yourself and that community.""
Obama also reflected on his approach to the civil war in Syria, as it approaches its sixth year with hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced around the world.
The president acknowledged that his ""red line"" declaration about the use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar Assad's government wasn't in his 2012 speech and that he didn't have to use those words. They later prompted harsh criticism, since the U.S. did not follow through on the threat.
""I would have, I think, made a bigger mistake if I had said, 'Eh, chemical weapons. That doesn't really change my calculus,'"" he said. ""And regardless of how it ended up playing, I think, in the Beltway, what is true is Assad got rid of his chemical weapons.""",neutral
353,"A consensus has emerged in the media—which, as we know, never get it wrong—that Donald Trump has squandered his transition.
And the polls prove it, journalists say.
It was polls, of course, that assured the media establishment that Hillary Clinton would be sworn in on Friday.
I don’t think the picture is as dire as many are suggesting, and here’s why:
Most incoming presidents don’t do much during their transitions. They pick a Cabinet and White House staff, make a few pronouncements, hold a news conference. There’s a natural rise in their ratings because they haven’t done much to make anyone mad, and are basking in the glow of feature stories about their style and their families and their pets.
Trump, by contrast, has been constantly in the news during his transition, totally overshadowing Barack Obama. He’s unleashed the Twitter. He has held forth on car manufacturers, intel agencies, Russia, health care and nuclear policy, not to mention Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has constantly attacked the media.
In short, Trump has stuck to the same combative style that won him the presidency but also alienates many of those who didn’t vote for him.
Gallup reports that 44 percent approve of his transition and 51 percent disapprove. The comparable numbers for Obama (83/12), George W. Bush (61/25) and Bill Clinton (68/18) make the contrast clear.
A Quinnipiac survey gives him lower marks (37/51), and 45 percent say he will be a worse president than Obama, 34 percent a better president and 15 percent about the same.
The Washington Post’s Dan Balz puts it this way:
“No president in memory has come to the brink of his inauguration with such a smorgasbord of potential problems and unanswered questions, or with the level of public doubts that exist around his leadership. Though he dealt with the issues directly on Wednesday, what he could not answer — what he cannot answer until he is in the Oval Office — is whether he can avoid having these kinds of questions plague and possibly debilitate his presidency over the next four years.
“Trump and his advisers have dismissed much of the pre-inaugural controversy as part of an effort to delegitimize his election victory and undermine his presidency even before he takes office. Still, the questions swirling around him as he came to the lobby of Trump Tower were an unprecedented mixture of the personal, the financial and the substantive.”
There are actually pluses and minuses to the Trump approach.
If he had spent the transition getting a tan at Mar-a-Lago, his approval ratings would be better. He wouldn’t be picking fights and staking out controversial positions, or giving the media fodder for negative pieces.
He also wouldn’t be Trump.
Instead, he is redefining the transition the way he redefined the nature of campaigning for president.
He is laying down markers and setting things in motion for after the swearing-in. He can claim some symbolic victories, such as companies that are rethinking or changing plans to move jobs out of the country. He has fired up his base on signature issues. And while detractors found his Trump Tower presser chaotic, he stuck to his guns on key issues and stuck it to the media, while also sliding in his lawyer to defend his plan not to divest his stake in the Trump Organization.
Trump won a close election and lost the popular vote. So by hitting the ground running, he’s about where he was on Nov. 8, with fierce supporters and outraged critics in a divided country.
Transitions have a way of quickly fading into history. The more telling polls will take place once Donald Trump is actually governing.
Spicer vs. Acosta
On “Media Buzz” yesterday, incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer amplified his criticism of Jim Acosta, saying the CNN correspondent was “childish” and “disrespectful” in repeatedly interrupting Donald Trump at a news conference. But then he went a step further.
Spicer said Acosta “lied about the events of that day, he was 100 percent false.” After the show I reached out to CNN for comment, and the network is strongly backing its reporter.
Spicer says Acosta claimed that in a conversation after the presser the spokesman “told him if he asked a hard question [next time] he’d be removed, that’s 100 percent not true.” As Spicer recounted the episode, Acosta disagreed with his contention that he’d been disrespectful to the president-elect.
“I said, ‘Jim I want to be clear, if that happens again I will have you removed,' the same way we’d remove a protester that was acting as disrespectful as he did.” Spicer added that he, and Trump, have no problem with “hard” questions.
Acosta had demanded to be recognized after Trump criticized CNN’s role in publicizing an unsubstantiated dossier alleging that the Russians had “compromising” information about him, but without airing any details. Trump refused and kept disparaging CNN.
A CNN spokesperson told me, “As we have learned many times, just because Sean Spicer says something doesn’t make it true.
“Jim Acosta is a veteran reporter with the utmost integrity and extensive experience in covering both the White House and the president-elect. Being persistent and asking tough questions is his job, and he has our complete support.”",negative
354,"Second Amendment advocates hope President-elect Donald Trump will reverse a new rule by the outgoing Obama administration under which the Social Security system could be used to block gun purchases for thousands of benefit recipients.
“We’ve already made the request to the Trump administration to look at repealing this,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, told FoxNews.com.
The Social Security Administration finalized a rule in December under which the agency would submit information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) on recipients of disability insurance and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if the government determines they are “mental defectives,” and unable to manage their own affairs.
Gun control groups insist the government should take action to keep guns away from the mentally ill, citing the recent airport shooting in Fort Lauderdale. But critics of the SSA rule contend the system could use overly broad criteria to end up denying guns to “harmless, law abiding” people with no history of violence.
One concern is how a similar program has worked at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has been reporting some veterans to the background check system when they have been unable to manage their own financial affairs. The VA reported the names of more than 257,000 military veterans who couldn’t manage their finances. A 2012 Congressional Research Service report found 99.3 percent of all names reported on the background check system as “mental defectives” came from the VA.
“Now it will be the same premise with Social Security if grandpa has trouble paying the bills,” Pratt said.
The SSA change was months in the making. President Obama’s White House announced a package of executive actions in January 2016 that said, “The Social Security Administration has indicated that it will begin the rulemaking process to include information in the background check system about beneficiaries who are prohibited from possessing a firearm for mental health reasons.” The rule was not finalized until Dec. 19.
Kate Folmar, spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said this is part of a larger push to ensure the mentally ill don’t obtain weapons.
“Certainly the Fort Lauderdale shooting incident highlights that more can be done to keep guns out of dangerous hands,” Folmer told FoxNews.com. “For example, four states -- Connecticut, Indiana, California and most recently Washington State -- have laws on the books that allow family members and law enforcement to petition courts to remove someone's weapons if he is a threat to himself or others; these laws include specific provisions to protect the individual's right to due process.”
The new rule is meant to comply with the 2007 NICS Improvement Amendments Act, which requires federal agencies to provide relevant information to the Justice Department for inclusion in the background check system, SSA spokesman Darren Lutz told FoxNews.com.
“This is why Social Security is planning to refer the records of affected individuals to the NICS, in accordance with the policies described in the regulation,” Lutz said. “Social Security will not refer the records of all Social Security beneficiaries to the NICS database.”
Specifically, the regulation affects anyone from 18 years old through retirement age who qualifies for disability because of a “mental impairment” that prevents the person from working who must have a “representative payee” for handling their finances, Lutz said.
According to the rule, if Social Security first determines that someone else is handling a person’s financial affairs, it will look at whether the person is mentally impaired. The rule states, “at the commencement of the adjudication process we will also notify individuals, both orally and in writing, of their possible federal prohibition on possessing or receiving firearms, the consequences of such prohibition, the criminal penalties for violating the Gun Control Act, and the availability of relief from the prohibition on the receipt or possession of firearms imposed by federal law.”
This will affect “tens of thousands of harmless, law-abiding people,” who will lose a constitutional right without due process, according to the National Rifle Association, which also plans to ask the incoming Trump administration to take “corrective action” on the matter.
“At no point in the actual ‘adjudication’ is the individual’s propensity for violence a necessary consideration,” said an NRA statement issued after the rule was finalized. “Rather, the question ultimately devolves to whether or not the individual has any sort of mental condition and can responsibly handle money, which is not a fair basis to strip someone of their constitutional rights.”
In July, Elizabeth Avore, legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety, expressed support for the regulation in a letter during the public comment period.
“Everytown applauds the White House for a set of recent executive actions aimed at improving the gun background check system and giving law enforcement tools to combat gun trafficking,” Avore’s letter said. “Those actions included initiating this rulemaking process, which seeks to bring the SSA in line with the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 ('the NIAA') requirement that federal agencies submit prohibiting records into NICS.”",positive
355,"Donald Trump is getting some low marks for his transition from White House winner to U.S. president, but some experts and supporters disagree, or at least urge Americans to wait before submitting a final grade.
“I don’t think it’s true. The transition is a means to an end, not an end itself,” Max Stier, of the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition, said Monday. “So far, I’d give him an incomplete. Ask me again in three months.”
Stier argues that Trump, or any U.S. president, needs about a year before their transition effort comes into full view.
Some of Trump’s early challenges, or problems, may be inherent or self-inflicted -- including his continuing strategy of eviscerating critics on Twitter.
Recent polls show a slim majority of Americans unhappy with Trump’s transition efforts.
A Gallup survey released Monday shows 51 percent of respondents do not approve of how Trump, a Republican, is handling the transition, which has largely consisted of nominating Cabinet members and signaling first-100-days policy goals.
President Obama, by comparison, had a roughly 12 percent disapproval rating about a week before taking office in 2009, according to Gallup. And a Quinnipiac survey released last week also showed roughly 51 percent of respondents are unsatisfied with Trump as a president-elect.
Still, Trump, like other incoming presidents, faces a long-standing congressional mandate requiring Senate confirmation for roughly 1,200 federal nominees, a process slowed by partisan politics and the sheer burden of completing background checks.
Doug Wilson, a Democrat, recently wrote in The Washington Post about his failed, three-year effort to get appointed to a part-time, non-paying position on the non-partisan U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy.
“In theory, with the White House and the Senate unified politically, the process should be easier,” Wilson wrote. “But ... senators can still block nominations without furnishing an explanation or even identifying themselves.
“If we want these positions to be filled by experienced and talented people, we need political leaders who will focus on nominee qualifications and ignore the rest -- and we need a government that checks their backgrounds more quickly.”
In 2011, Congress, in fact, eliminated hundreds of posts subject to Senate confirmation.
“You’ll get a better government if you do that,” Stier said. “Then Congress could focus on the positions that need attention.”
Another self-induced problem for Trump is that his winning, outsider operation does not have a lot of people with Executive Branch experience.
However, Stier does not see the contradiction, or inconsistency, in Trump tapping some insiders to help with the transition while promising to “drain the swamp” in Washington.
“You need so-called insiders,” Stier said. “Many who want to see change are most familiar with how to get that change. .. The real question is will Trump's government work.”
Joe Desilets, a Republican strategist and senior staffer on Trump’s Pennsylvania campaign team, argued that Trump and his transition team have been “incredibly successful” on several fronts, despite the more liberal media continuing to report about Americans unwilling to accept Trump’s win.
“The Cabinet that President-elect Trump has assembled is a long list of incredible leaders from industry, politics and the military,” Desilets said. “Most importantly, Trump is putting together the team that he needs to enact the agenda and policies that he put forward to the American people during his campaign.”",neutral

362,"In media mythology, the first 100 days is make-or-break time for a new president and an easily packaged time frame that is, of course, inherently arbitrary.
While the phrase conjures up an FDR-like New Deal, it can also be a tough slog as a new president tries to push legislation through Congress, get nominees confirmed and becomes enveloped by Beltway process stories.
But given Donald Trump’s unique status as an outsider who ran against the establishment of both parties, the first 100 days could be more fiery than usual. And that’s what Martha MacCallum is banking on.
“We have to hold his feet to the fire,” she told me in a phone interview.
The “America’s Newsroom” co-host is launching a new show Monday at 7 p.m. ET to chronicle the debut of the Trump administration.
MacCallum, a onetime Wall Street Journal staffer and stock exchange reporter for CNBC, says the business community is counting on Trump slashing regulations and cutting taxes. “That in many ways is what the market is reading,” she said. “He needs to make sure that’s one of his top priorities.”
MARTHA MACCALLUM SET TO PREMIERE NEW PRIMETIME SHOW 'THE FIRST 100 DAYS'
On Sunday's ""Media Buzz,"" MacCallum said that ""the question has hung out there"" since the election: ""Will he become more presidential when he takes that oath of office?"" As for the controversies that surround his statements and misstatements, she said: ""I think in a strange way there’s an acceptance of exaggeration with Donald Trump that we haven’t had with former presidents.""
A political science major at St. Lawrence University in upstate New York, MacCallum says politics -- and history -- have always been her passion. She paid some serious dues, waitressing at four Manhattan restaurants while working as a fact-checker at a financial magazine. She also “got bitten by the theater bug,” studied acting and directing in graduate school and worked with a small theater company -- which may have helped her future career.
“At the time I would have scoffed at any connection between the pure art form of theater having any relation to the news,” she says. “But in both it’s about connecting with your viewers…To be a good waitress is an art. You’ve got to juggle a lot of tables and people.”
The reason she’ll be serving up the new fare at 7 p.m. on Fox is that the slot opened up when Megyn Kelly decided to leave for NBC and Tucker Carlson’s new show was moved to 9 p.m. MacCallum, who has three children, isn’t sure she’ll continue in the evening -- she loves her morning partnership with Bill Hemmer -- but she is pumped about raising the curtain on the Trump presidency.

363,"EXCLUSIVE: Nearly two dozen former top U.S. government officials have urged President-elect Donald Trump to work with Iran's opposition once in office, according to a letter obtained by Fox News.
A letter signed by 23 former officeholders calls on Trump to consult with the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). The group has called for free elections and freedom of religion in Iran, as well as an end to what it calls Tehran's ""religious dictatorship.""
READ THE LETTER
While the Iranian government calls the group terrorists, the NCRI’s network of supporters in Iran helped the U.S. with intelligence during the Iraq invasion. The group also helped expose Iran's nascent nuclear weapons program.
""Iran's rulers have directly targeted US strategic interests, policies and principles, and those of our allies and friends in the Middle East,"" the letter reads, in part. ""To restore American influence and credibility in the world, the United States needs a revised policy.""
The letter's signatories include former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Sen. Joe Lieberman; and retired Army Gen. Hugh Shelton, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Bill Clinton.

365,"China said Sunday that its one-China policy is “non-negotiable” after President-elect Donald Trump suggested that he might use American policy on Taiwan as a bargaining chip between the two sides.
China Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang reiterated in a statement that the “government of the People’s Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing China.”
""That is the fact acknowledged by the international community and no one can change,” Lu added.
Since recognizing Beijing in 1979, Washington has maintained only unofficial ties with Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing considers its territory — a status quo that Trump has repeatedly threatened to upend since winning the November election.
Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that “everything is under negotiation, including ‘one China.’” The interview is the latest indication Trump that he will shake up the U.S.-China relationship, particularly on Taiwan, which China considers a core national interest.
China had already been rattled over Trump’s call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, the first time an American president or president-elect had publicly spoken to Taiwan’s leader in nearly four decades.
Trump then said in a television interview that he didn't feel ""bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.""
After attacking China repeatedly during his campaign, Trump has continued to disparage China on his Twitter account over its military build-up in disputed areas of the South China Sea, allegedly manipulating its currency to put American companies at a disadvantage, and not doing enough to curb North Korea's nuclear program.
He has also announced that a new White House trade council will be led by economist Peter Navarro, a sharp critic of Chinese economic policy who wrote a book titled ""Death By China.""
Trump told the Journal that he would not label China a currency manipulator as soon as he takes office, though he repeated his contention that China is manipulating the yuan.
So far, Beijing has reiterated its refusal to negotiate on Taiwan and to push for positive cooperation between the two sides, though state-run media have run several strongly worded editorials attacking Trump.

366,"President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural committee has raised a record $90 million in private donations to pay for the steep costs of next weekend’s festivities.
It's the most any president has raised for their inauguration and it outpaces the amount collected by President Barack Obama’s two inaugural committees - $55 million in 2009 and $43 million in 2013, the Associated Press reported.
Donations include $500,000 from Chevron and $1 million given by Boeing. AT&T says it has made both cash and in-kind donations, including quintupling phone capacity on the National Mall.
DEMOCRATIC REP. LEWIS: TRUMP NOT A 'LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT'
The committee has 90 days after the Jan. 20 inauguration to reveal the rest of the donors.
Trump’s committee has declined to provide details on how it’s aiming to spend the money. However, lead inaugural planner Tom Barrack said this week the team wants to avoid a “circus-like atmosphere” in favor of a more “back to work” mindset that surrounds Trump “with the soft sensuality of the place.”
Trump himself promised the event would be a ""very, very elegant day"" with ""massive crowds.""
Trump is holding three inaugural balls; Obama had 10 balls at his first inaugural. Trump's team also hopes to keep its parade to 90 minutes. The longest parade, with 73 bands and 59 floats, lasted more than four and half hours, at Dwight Eisenhower's first inauguration, in 1953
Spokesman Boris Epshteyn said the inaugural committee is ""fully focused on organizing world-class events that honor our nation's tremendous history and reach every corner of the globe."" Any excess money raised will be donated to charity.
Steve Kerrigan, CEO for Obama's inaugural committee in 2013 and chief of staff in 2009, said the $90 million fundraising haul looks like overkill.
""I can't imagine how they are going to spend that amount of money — and why they would even keep raising money,"" he said. ""We planned the two largest inaugurations in the history of our country and we never spent anywhere near that.""
HEAD OF DC NATIONAL GUARD TO STEP DOWN DURING INAUGURATION
While a big share of the cost is covered by the private donations, taxpayers provide a considerable amount as well. They're on the hook, for example, to cover the close to $5 million cost of building the bunting-decorated 10,000 square-foot platform built on the West Front of the Capitol for the swearing-in.
The public also pays security costs for an event that brings together a big chunk of the U.S. political leadership, hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans and a fair share of protesters. Because those expenses are scattered throughout the federal budget, it's hard to get a fix on just how much the day will cost.
Some tabs are spelled out: $1.25 million for the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, which is responsible for the swearing-in ceremony, inaugural luncheon and review of troops, and $2.5 million for overtime for U.S. Capitol Police.
More than 5,000 active duty service members and 7,500 National Guard members will take part, too. In 2009, spending by the military's inaugural joint task force and the Defense Department totaled $21.6 million.
District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser says the city expects to spend at least $30 million, with the federal government reimbursing the full amount. So far, Congress has appropriated $19 million, and the city will go back to Congress after the swearing-in to ask for the rest.

Lewis, a leader in the civil rights movement of the 1960s who was beaten by state troopers during the ""Bloody Sunday"" march from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama, says in an NBC's ""Meet the Press"" to air Sunday that he does not consider Trump a ""legitimate president,"" and blamed the Russians for helping the Republican win the White House.
""You know, I believe in forgiveness. I believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It's going to be very difficult. I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president,"" Lewis said.
Trump, in followup tweet Saturday, said Lewis should spend more time helping his ""crime invested"" district, instead of ""falsely complaining about the election results.""
""All talk, talk, talk -- no action or results. Sad."" Trump concluded.
Lewsi has said he will skip next week's inauguration of Trump at the Capitol, joining several other Democrats who have decided to boycott the historic event.
""I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton,"" Lewis said.
The Lewis-Trump fued escalted on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
U.S. Intelligence agencies have said Russia meddled in the election to help Trump win. After spending weeks challenging that assessment, Trump finally accepted that the Russians were behind the election-year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. However, he also emphasized that ""there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.""
Lewis explained his decision to stay away from the inauguration as ""you cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right.""
He said it will be the first inauguration he has missed in three decades, a time that includes Democrats and Republicans taking the oath of office.
Other Democratic lawmakers who have announced plans to skip the inauguration include Reps. Barbara Lee of California, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Luis Gutierrez of Illinois. They cite an array of reasons, but have one at least one thing in common. All represent heavily Democratic districts.

368,"The Donald Trump transition team has acknowledged that its incoming national security adviser has been in contact with Russia's ambassador but denies reports they were plotting over recently imposed sanctions on Moscow.
A transition team official acknowledged a call on Dec. 29, the day President Obama hit Russia for election-related hacking, but said the conversation was about “logistics” for a call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, who on Friday is sworn-in as president.
“That was it. Plain and simple,” the official told reporters on the team’s daily conference call.
The official said retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, texted Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to wish him a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. He said Kislyak, in a return text, requested and was granted a phone conversation in late December about the “logistics of setting up call with the president of Russia and the president-elect.”
Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador were first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius.
“I believe Ignatius will print an update now that he has been provided information to clarify,” the transition official also said.
It's not unusual for incoming administrations to have discussions with foreign governments before taking office. But repeated contacts just as Obama imposed sanctions raised questions about whether Trump's team discussed -- or even helped shape -- Russia's response.
Reuters reports that Flynn and Kislyak talked several times on Dec. 29.
Putin unexpectedly did not retaliate against the U.S. for the move, a decision Trump quickly praised.
More broadly, Flynn's contact with the Russian ambassador suggests the incoming administration has already begun to lay the groundwork for its promised closer relationship with Moscow.
That effort appears to be moving ahead, even as many in Washington, including Republicans, have expressed outrage over intelligence officials' assessment that Putin launched a hacking operation aimed at meddling in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump.
In an interview published Friday evening by The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he might do away with Obama's sanctions if Russia works with the U.S. on battling terrorists and achieving other goals.
""If Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions?"" he asked.
During a news conference Wednesday, Trump highlighted his warmer rapport with the Russian leader.
""If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia,"" he said.
The sanctions targeted the GRU and FSB, leading Russian intelligence agencies that the U.S. said were involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other groups. The U.S. also kicked out 35 Russian diplomats who it said were actually intelligence operatives.
Trump has been willing to insert himself into major foreign policy issues during the transition, at times contradicting the current administration and diplomatic protocol.
He accepted a call from Taiwan's president, ignoring the longstanding ""One China"" policy that does not recognize the island's sovereignty. Asked about that Friday by the Journal, he responded, ""Everything is under negotiation.""
He also publicly urged the U.S. to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, then slammed the Obama administration for abstaining and allowing the measure to pass.
Questions about Trump's friendly posture toward Russia have deepened since the election, as he has dismissed U.S. intelligence agencies' assertions about Russia's role in the hacking of Democratic groups.
In briefing Trump on their findings, intelligence officials also presented the president-elect with unsubstantiated claims that Russia had amassed compromising personal and financial allegations about him, according to a separate U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter.
The Senate Intelligence Committee announced late Friday that it would investigate possible contacts between Russia and people associated with U.S. political campaigns as part of a broader investigation into Moscow's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Trump acknowledged for the first time this week that he accepts that Russia was behind the hacking. But he questioned whether officials were leaking information about their meetings with him, warning that would be a ""tremendous blot"" on their record.
Flynn's own ties with Russia have worried some Republicans who are more skeptical of the Kremlin than Trump appears to be. After leaving his position as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, Flynn made appearances on RT, a state-run Russian television network. In 2015, he was paid to attend an RT gala in Moscow, where he sat next to Putin.
As national security adviser, Flynn will work in the West Wing close to the Oval Office and will have frequent access to Trump. Unlike Trump's nominees to lead the Pentagon, State Department and other national security agencies, Flynn's post does not require Senate confirmation.
Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador were first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. The U.S. official who spoke to The Associated Press was not authorized to confirm the contacts publicly and insisted on anonymity.
The Trump team's account of Flynn's contacts with the Russian envoy changed throughout the day Friday.
Trump spokesman Sean Spicer initially said there was one phone call between Flynn and Kislyak on Dec. 28, as well as a Christmas greeting via text messages over the holidays. He said sanctions were not part of the discussions.
Later Friday, a transition official said Flynn and Kislyak had spoken by phone on Dec. 29, following a text message from the ambassador the day before. During the call, the Russian ambassador invited U.S. officials to a conference on Syria later this month that is being held in Kazakhstan, according to the transition official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and insisted on anonymity.
The official also confirmed a phone call between the men earlier in December.
The U.S. official who spoke to the AP Friday described the contacts between Flynn and Kislyak as ""very frequent.""
It's unclear how U.S. officials became aware of the contacts between Flynn and Kislyak, who has served as Russia's envoy to the U.S. since 2008. U.S. monitoring of Russian officials' communication within the United States is known to be common.
Flynn has spoken with other foreign officials since Trump won the November election, as have incoming White House senior advisers Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. State
Department spokesman Mark Toner said he saw nothing inappropriate in Trump's transition team contacting Russian or any other foreign officials.

TRUMP WAS NOT GIVEN ANY SUMMARY OF RUSSIAN CLAIMS ABOUT COMPROMISED INFO, SOURCE SAYS
Late Tuesday, BuzzFeed published a dossier prepared by a former British intelligence officer that claimed, among other things, that Cohen had met with Russian operatives in Prague this past August to discuss the gathering of possible political intelligence to use against Hillary Clinton.
I have never been to Prague in my life. #fakenews pic.twitter.com/CMil9Rha3D — Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) January 11, 2017
Soon after the report was published, Cohen denied that he was in Prague during the period alleged in the dossier. Cohen told Washingtonian magazine that the only trip he took during that time was with his son to Los Angeles, where they visited the baseball program at USC.
Cohen told Sean Hannity that Trump himself asked Cohen to produce his passport after details of the dossier were made public.
""So he said, ‘Michael, I really need to know.’"" Cohen said. ""I said, ‘Mr. Trump, I have never been to Prague.’ He said to me, ‘OK.’ I said, ‘You want to see my passport?’ I live close to the office, and he said ‘You mind if I see it?’ I said ‘Of course not, you’re the president-elect. I’ll be there in about two minutes.’""
Cohen added that those who disbelieve his story are asking him to prove a negative.
""How am I supposed to argue when I’m telling you this is where I was at? They’re claiming ‘Oh, no, you weren’t there.’ I said, ‘Yes, I was. I was there. I was in Los Angeles.' ‘Well, why were you there?’ What’s the difference why I was there?"" Cohen asked. ""I was not in Prague.

TRUMP SPARS WITH REPORTER FOLLOWING RUSSIA CLAIMS
Acosta repeatedly called on Trump to let him ask a question after the president-elect disparaged reports by CNN and BuzzFeed that Russian spies have collected compromising information about him. Trump refused to call on Acosta, at one point telling him ""Don't be rude"" before finally blasting CNN's report as ""fake news.""
After the press conference, Spicer said he approached Acosta and ""I informed him that I thought that no one should be treated that ... disrespectfully, and that if he did it again in the future, I would have him removed.""
""No one needs to be treated with that level of disrespect and rudeness,"" Spicer later added.
The former Republican National Committee spokesman added that the contentious nature of Wednesday's presser could be a preview of future briefings under a Trump administration.
""If you want to have a conversation and engage in a polite and respectful manner with the president-elect, he’s gonna treat you in kind,"" Spicer said.

371,"The nation's top intel chief called President-elect Donald Trump Wednesday to personally deny leaking to the media a dubious dossier of allegations about sensitive information the Russians supposedly had about him.
Trump confirmed Thursday that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper spoke to him by phone, apparently sometime after a press conference in which Trump lashed out at media outlets, including Buzzfeed and CNN, that ran with the story and speculated it was leaked by federal officials.
""James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated,"" Trump tweeted. ""Made up, phony facts.Too bad!""
On Wednesday, Clapper released a rare statement addressing rising tensions between spy agency chiefs and Trump, who believes the intel community has become politicized and is working to undermine him. He also acknowledged contacting Trump directly to express ""profound dismay"" about the leaks to CNN and Buzzfeed — the latter of which published the unverified allegations in full.
""I emphasized that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC,"" Clapper said. ""The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions.""
Several media outlets reported that the salacious material, originally compiled by a former British intelligence officer turned political consultant, was relayed to Trump when he was briefed on the intelligence community's evidence of Russian hacking in the 2016 election.
But Trump never received any summary of unsubstantiated allegations that Russian spies had collected compromising financial and personal information about him, a highly placed transition source told Fox News Wednesday.
The source said that intelligence officials who briefed Trump on Friday brought up the allegations verbally, but added that they were ""barely mentioned in passing.""
A government source told Fox News that the intelligence community wanted to give Trump a heads-up that the allegations had been widely circulating and that a lot of media outlets were sitting on the story. The source said the claims did not constitute a ""central element"" of Trump's briefing.
CNN initially reported that Trump and President Obama were presented with a two-page summary that detailed the allegations. The report said the summary was attached to a broader report about Russian operatives' activities during the 2016 election.
At the Wednesday press conference, Trump said that he had learned details of the allegations ""outside of the meeting"" with intelligence officials.
""It's all fake news. It's phony stuff. It didn't happen,"" Trump said, later adding. ""But I read what was released and I think it's a disgrace. I think it's an absolute disgrace.""

372,"The former British spy who allegedly created an incriminating but now-discredited dossier on President-elect Donald Trump has gone into hiding.
Christopher David Steele, 52, was seen hurriedly leaving his home southwest of London on Wednesday, apparently to avoid detection and escape possible retribution once his identity as the source of the salacious document became known, the New York Times reported.
The 35-page dossier, describing Trump’s allegedly improper conduct in Russia, was commissioned last year by a Washington firm working for Trump’s primary opponents to find incriminating information on the real estate tycoon. The document suggests that the Kremlin has information about Trump’s conduct and financial dealings that it could use to blackmail him. The document was circulated among Trump opponents over the summer, NBCNews said.
The FBI and U.S. intelligence officials also got a copy of the document. They decided to include a two-page summary of the dossier in an intelligence presentation about Russia’s effort to interfere in the U.S. elections to Trump and President Obama.
After that presentation, BuzzFeed published the material, apparently without checking to see if it was factual. Several other news organizations, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, had access to the dossier but declined to publish the material because it could not be verified.
Trump lashed out at the media for publishing the unsubstantiated material and at the U.S. intelligence officials, accusing them of leaking the allegations and likening the leaks to Nazi conduct.
A person close to Steele said he left his home because he now fears a prompt and potentially dangerous backlash from Moscow against him and his family, the Telegraph reported.
Steele spent years working undercover in Russia, London and France for MI-6, Britain’s spy agency. Since leaving MI-6 he has been a director of Orbis Business Intelligence, a private London-based security and investigation firm, founded in 2009, the Telegraph said.
The firm’s website says it provides “real-time source reporting on business and politics at all levels” and “draws on extensive experience at the boardroom level in government, multilateral diplomacy and international business to develop bespoke solutions for clients,” the Times reported.
Steele founded the firm with Christopher Parker-Burrows, who is now 58. His LinkedIn page describes him as a former counselor with the U.K.’s Foreign Office who worked in Brussels and New Delhi. Burrows told the Independent that he would not confirm or deny that Orbis produced the dossier.
Retired CIA operative John Sipher said Steele has a good reputation within the intelligence community and “some credibility,” the Times reported. He also said he is confident the FBI will investigate the matter.
Before developing the material on Trump, Steele was hired to investigate former European Commission Vice President Kristalina Georgieva, EurActiv.com said. Steele’s work occurred while Georgieva was a candidate for U.N. secretary-general.
Steele was specifically tasked with investigating her alleged links to a Bulgarian organized crime group known as Multigroup, a shady business empire run by Iliya Pavlov who was assassinated in Sofia in 2003.
Last October Georgieva resigned from the European Commission to take a job with the World Bank.",negative
373,"CIA officer Sabrina De Sousa was skiing with her son in Northern Italy on a chilly February day in 2003 when agents snatched a suspected terrorist off the streets of Milan as part of the CIA's ""extraordinary rendition"" program.
Fourteen years later, De Sousa faces imminent extradition from Portugal to Italy and six years in jail in connection with the abduction after being convicted in absentia by Italian courts for a decision made by the highest levels of U.S. government.
De Sousa, who no longer works for the agency, is now poised to become the first CIA officer and U.S. diplomat imprisoned over the controversial rendition program -- and is making an urgent appeal for intervention.
""I'm a scapegoat,"" De Sousa told FoxNews.com Wednesday, in an extensive phone interview from her home in Portugal.
The former officer claims the Obama administration has ignored all requests to intervene on her behalf but hopes the incoming Donald Trump administration might be able to help.
Time is not on her side.
Trump's inauguration would come after the Italy-set Jan. 17 extradition date. According to De Sousa, this would ""set a hugely bad precedent for the conviction by an allied nation of a U.S. diplomat.""
HOEKSTRA: DON'T LET ONE OF OUR INTEL OFFICERS WIND UP IN JAIL
De Souza was working in Milan as an undercover CIA officer in 2003 when U.S. and Italian intelligence agents abducted radical Egyptian cleric, Osama Mustapha Hassan Nasr -- also known as Abu Omar -- and transported him to his native Egypt for interrogation.
The authorized operation was part of the controversial program implemented under President George W. Bush in which terror suspects could be transferred to countries where torture is allowed.
Omar -- who turned out to be a ""nobody,"" according to De Sousa -- was held at an American military base in Germany before being flown to Cairo, Egypt, where he claims he was tortured. He was soon released from prison for lack of prosecutable evidence against him.
In 2009, De Sousa, along with 25 other Americans, were convicted in absentia on kidnapping and other charges related to the abduction. Several were since pardoned and not one has done time in prison. The Italians also convicted Omar in absentia of ""criminal association for the purposes of international terrorism"" and sentenced him to six years in prison.
Phone records obtained by Italian prosecutors corroborated De Sousa's claim that she was some 130 miles away in Madonna di Campiglio, Italy, chaperoning her son's school ski trip, on the day Omar was abducted. Still, Italy brought ""broad charges"" against her for a plot she says she had no direct part in.
""[The Italians] said, 'She was responsible for planning and without her OK, it never would have happened,'"" De Sousa told FoxNews.com. ""And this came third-hand from someone who told an Italian intelligence officer.""
""We are being convicted for decisions made for which we had no input at all,"" she said. ""Nobody wants to look any higher, and this is the best way to deflect attention from anyone else.""
The former spy, who was born in India and holds both American and Portuguese passports, left the CIA in 2009 and moved to Portugal in April 2015 to be near family.
In October 2015, she was detained at Lisbon's airport on a European arrest warrant while attempting to travel to India. She was later released but ordered to remain in Portugal.
The series of events that followed amount to an international legal nightmare.
Italy first sought extradition of De Sousa with the guarantee of a retrial or appeal with new evidence, acknowledging she had been tried in absentia. Based on these guarantees, the Portuguese courts agreed to extradite.
But in June 2016, Italy sent Portugal a letter saying De Sousa's conviction was final, and no retrial would be granted. In a move that shocked De Sousa and others in the intelligence community, Portugal's high court ordered her immediate extradition.
De Sousa acknowledges her move from the U.S. to Portugal was ""catastrophic."" The 61-year-old mother, who recently underwent eye surgery, has been ordered by her doctor to remain in Portugal until her recovery. Her extradition date is now set for Jan. 17.
This follows years of unsuccessful bids to clear her name. De Sousa said she continues to cling to hope that a new administration might come to her aid.
""I would really like to reach out to the Trump administration,"" she said, noting that, in her view, the president-elect is beholden to no one and not interested in protecting those who authorized the program.
""I think a General [Mike] Flynn in the administration – I can't see him allowing the prosecution of a senior military officer by a foreign nation,"" she said.
It's unclear what action, if any, the Trump administration may take on the case, but a member of the transition team has sent background information on De Sousa's situation to senior officials with the incoming administration, FoxNews.com has learned.
Transition team spokesmen have not responded to requests for an official comment.
Asked for comment on the case, a State Department spokesperson referred FoxNews.com to De Sousa’s lawyer for specific details but said they’ve seen reports that a Portuguese Court plans to transfer her and “we can say that the Department of State takes its obligation to assist U.S. citizens overseas seriously.”
The official said: ""This is a matter that U.S. officials have been following closely. We have asked our European counterparts what their next steps may be, but we are not in a position to detail those discussions.""
Aside from warnings about the precedent that could be set, De Sousa also claimed such a trial would be unfair, since she would not be permitted to divulge state secrets.
Former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., an outspoken advocate of De Sousa, said he has appealed to members of the Obama administration on her behalf -- because ""it seemed like a slam-dunk case.""
""What’s happening to her is inherently wrong,"" Hoekstra told FoxNews.com. ""You’ve got an alleged case officer who's going to go to jail [for] doing exactly what the American government ... asked her to do.""
""The executive branch leaders can continue to travel throughout Europe -- they face no consequences,"" he said. ""Some of the people have gotten pardons and all of the Italians no longer face consequences.""
Hoekstra, too, expressed hope that Trump would intervene.
""Donald Trump supports the little guy,"" he said. ""And I think in this case I would like to believe and I would expect that he would be on the side of Sabrina.""",positive
374,"Every four years, D.C. residents get a chance to witness history – and make some money on the side.
That is certainly the case ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, as hotels, homeowners and businesses across the District look to profit from the influx of spectators and protesters alike.
Experts estimate about 400,000 to 500,000 people will come to Washington for the events, short of the estimated 1.8 million who arrived for the first Obama inauguration but still enough to jolt the local economy.
Analysts expect the visitors will spend more than a billion dollars all together.
“It has an enormous economic impact,” said Stephen Fuller, public policy professor at George Mason University. “The context is that this is the slowest time of year for the economy. … Hotels have the lowest occupancy rates in January, February, around 40 percent, so anything that changes that can have enormous impact.”
The road to these hospitality industry riches, however, has been rocky.
Many hotels and private homes were booked well in advance of the actual election. Airbnb, which allows homeowners to rent out residences on a short-term basis, saw a huge spike in prices and bookings.
But that may have been when many prospective visitors thought Hillary Clinton would be the victor. Then Donald Trump won.
One person who manages those kinds of bookings in the region said he had a 90 percent cancellation rate in the 48 hours after the election.
Since that time, though, room stays are back on the rise.
Airbnb now says bookings in the D.C. area are about to hit an all-time high leading into the inauguration.
A scan of local hotel rates found a significant spike for the three or four days around the inauguration. And one of the Ritz-Carltons in Washington is completely sold out – room rates ranged from roughly $6,000 to $40,000 for a four-night package.

375,"Mexican drug cartels and human traffickers are cashing in ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration by exploiting anxiety over his vow to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration – fueling the latest surge across the U.S.-Mexico line, according to local law enforcement.
The president-elect reiterated his pledge at a press conference Wednesday to build a ""wall"" – which he claims will curb illegal immigration, reduce gun violence and stop drugs from being smuggled into the country.
For now, however, the Obama administration's leniency, combined with concerns about Trump's crackdown, is seen as contributing to a spike in crossings from California to Texas.
“There’s definitely a percentage of folks who believed that they can beat the clock,” said Jose Villareal, chief of operations for the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector.
On a recent ride-along in south Texas, Cameron County Sheriff's Office Lt. Robert Rodriguez told FoxNews.com he has noted an increase in the flow of border crossers since Trump’s White House win.
“I can feel the anxiety,” Rodriguez said. “You can cut it with a knife.”
He said: “We see more and more people cross every day. ... The cartels are taking advantage of people being scared.”
Rodriguez patrols a patch of road that includes the most southern tip of Texas. He’s seen battered bodies float lifeless down the Rio Grande River and is no stranger to the sight of corpses – from babies to men in their 80s – littered along the land. Some were shot by drug lords, human traffickers and cartel members, while others were abandoned by their “coyotes” – paid guides to get them across the border.
He says moving people across the border is a high-stakes shell game that authorities at the local, state and federal level are losing.
Rodriguez, who says he's been in two shootouts, has seen people come over on foot and packed in passenger vehicles as well as ferried over the Rio Grande in rafts.
“This is ground zero of the problem,” Rodriguez said of the route known as Farm to Market Road 1419 in Cameron County. As for the human carnage he has witnessed, he said, “You’re a commodity. You’re a thing.”
And the traffickers who see border crossers this way are looking at boom times -- at least for now.
In November, U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 47,214 migrants along the southwest U.S. border – an increase of 44 percent compared with a year earlier. November was the Border Patrol’s busiest month since June 2014. In the past six months, agents have caught nearly a quarter-million migrants -- about 1,300 a day -- trying to cross illegally.
“Smugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there’s a chance,” Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., recently told Fox News.
In response, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection dispatched 150 more agents to police the southwestern border. They also opened two temporary facilities to detain thousands of people trying to come over illegally.
""CBP is prepared to add housing, beds, toilets and bathing facilities as necessary,"" it said in a statement. ""CBP is addressing this migratory surge along the southwest border in a humane way, consistent with our border security mission and our American values.""
The border itself remains a challenge.
Of the 315 miles of border in the Rio Grande Valley, only 54 miles have a border fence. The sector, made up of 34,000 square miles of U.S. territory, accounts for more than half of the migrant apprehensions each year.
As the son of Mexican migrant workers who crossed the border illegally decades ago – they later became naturalized citizens – Rodriguez believes talk of the border wall is Washington window-dressing for a more complicated problem.
“Smugglers change their tactic all the time,” he said, adding that with a wall, people can go “underneath it, over it or around it.”
Most of the wall in Cameron County is 18 feet tall and made from rusty iron bars. In other parts, it’s fence. At a cost of more than $6 million per mile to build, the barrier runs through people’s backyards and farmers’ fields. There are gigantic gaps along the way -- stretches where the wall abruptly stops.
“There are actually openings in the wall,” Brownsville Mayor Tony Martinez told FoxNews.com. “I haven’t seen people go around the wall or over the wall. I’ve seen them go right through those openings.”
For some residents in the region, the rush of border crossers ahead of Trump taking office has bred fear.
One McAllen-area resident, who asked not to be named out of safety concerns for her young children, said she has seen a “big jump” in numbers.
“The area is enormous and there aren’t enough [authorities] out here,” she said. “We see people cross all the time. Could we say something? Should we? Of course, but what about our kids?”
Rodriguez says intimidation by cartel members is common and that scouts for coyotes and gangs are everywhere.
“One day, a resident complains and the next, there’s a blacked-out SUV in front of their house,” he said. “They get the message.”",positive
376,"The director of the federal government's ethics agency Wednesday blasted President-elect Donald Trump's plan to maintain his business empire by turning it over to his sons instead of selling off all his corporate assets and placing remaining profits in a government-approved blind trust.
U.S. Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub took the rare step Tuesday of commenting publicly about a presidential ethics decision, warning that Trump's solution to a potential cascade of conflicts spurred by his global business holdings breaks 40 years of precedent by presidents from both parties.
ETHICS OFFICIAL TAKES HEAT FOR KNOCKING TRUMP CABINET HEARINGS, GIVING CLINTON A 'PASS'
Shaub, a 2013 Obama appointee who also worked at the agency during the George W. Bush administration, openly pleaded with Trump to reconsider his plan before his inauguration. Shaub said Trump should commit to ""divestiture,"" a process under which he would sell his corporate assets and place the profit in a blind trust administered by a neutral trustee approved by the OGE.
Emails between the OGE and the Trump transition team obtained by the Associated Press show that Shaub repeatedly tried to engage with Trump's aides late last year to persuade the president-elect and his Cabinet choices to agree to divestiture as the cleanest way to clear aware potential ethics conflicts posed by their investments and businesses.
But while lawyers for several Trump picks, including prospective Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and senior adviser Jared Kushner, have worked closely with the OGE in shaping divestiture plans, Trump's own lawyers and aides gave the federal agency no official advance notice of his plan to turn over his global empire to his sons, according to an official familiar with interactions between the two sides.
The official, who requested anonymity to detail the sensitive contacts between the two sides, said that Shaub met once with Trump's prospective White House counsel, Don McGahn, in recent weeks, but only to discuss ethics plans for several of Trump's picks, not for Trump's own plan to deal with his holdings.
An outside attorney for Trump, Sherri Dillon of firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius, said Tuesday that Trump plans to have his companies' operations directed by his two sons, but they would pursue new deals only in the U.S., not abroad. Additionally, Dillon said, Trump would put his business assets in a trust but would hand over management of his international real estate firms to a management company based in New York.
Shaub said during a rare appearance at the Brookings Institution that he was ""especially troubled"" by Dillon's comment that Trump's liquid assets from stock and investment sales he made in recent months before the presidential election would be placed in a ""diversified portfolio of assets"" approved by the OGE.
""No one has ever talked to us about the idea, and there's no legal mechanism to do that,"" Shaub said. He added that the only OGE-approved method is the government-qualified blind trust set by the Ethics in Government Act.
Shaub said his agency's unusual Twitter comments last year complimenting Trump for considering divesting his assets was his decision, made to ""use the vernacular of the president-elect's favorite social media platform to encourage him to divest.""
Shaub said he now worries that Trump has no intention to go through government-approved divestiture, a move that risks ""creating the perception that government leaders would use their official positions for profit."" Shaub said he had been initially encouraged by a Trump tweet last year that ""no way"" would he allow any conflicts of interest.
""Unfortunately,"" Shaub said, ""his current plan cannot achieve that goal.""",positive

TRUMPS ERUPTS OVER SALACIOUS REPORT
In a press conference that was by turns both surreal and chaotic, President-elect Donald Trump today opened a new front in his ongoing fight with the press.
The crescendo came as Trump got into a shouting match with a CNN reporter that concluded with the incoming president denouncing the organization as “fake news.”
At issue is a report from the network that Trump was presented with evidence of the existence – widely known but unreported in political media – of uncorroborated claims that Russian agents had been trying to compromise Trump through bribery and blackmail.
CNN’s report, substantially corroborated by the NYT, went thermonuclear after the web site Buzzfeed published the actual allegations. What had been a significant but incremental scoop in the larger story about Russian interference in American politics turned into a tabloid sensation involving kinky sex.
Trump denied the alleged 2013 romps with Russian prostitutes, saying that he wouldn’t have done such a thing knowing that his hotel rooms were likely under surveillance.
“You’d better be careful or you’ll be watching yourself on nightly television,” Trump said of his warnings to his traveling companions.
Trump himself raised the most salacious claim, which involves his alleged interest in erotic micturition, saying that he would not have participated because he is “too much of a germaphobe.”
In the end Trump spent only about half of his first press conference since July actually answering questions.
The rest of the time was given over to Sean Spicer, the press secretary, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Trump’s tax attorney, Sherri Dillon, who outlined the arrangement Trump has chosen to avoid conflicts of interest.
The plan seems to exceed the initial expectation that Trump would look to fudge his withdrawal from business. The promised ethical strictures ought to be enough to appease all but his staunchest foes.
Here’s the gist: Trump’s holdings will be placed in a trust, he will relinquish all managerial control, his sons will run the company, they will not do deals in foreign countries and any revenue generated from foreign nationals will be donated to the Treasury.
Trump covered not just his plan for avoiding ethical entanglements, but also broke several other pieces of news. He named his choice to lead the troubled Veterans Affairs, David Schulkin, currently the undersecretary of health for the agency. Trump also said he would likely name his nominee to the Supreme Court the week after next.
And what would have been otherwise the biggest news of the day: Trump promised to immediately replace ObamaCare upon its repeal.
That’s a huge promise and arguably the most ambitious concrete policy promise yet from the new administration. Congress having to build and pass a replacement for the law at the outset would be daunting under normal circumstances. Given the current political chaos in Washington, though, it would be nearly miraculous.
Brace yourself for one of the biggest, baddest political fights since, well, the last time the government tackled health insurance.
But because of the sensational subject and because Trump fought with a reporter and discussed his aversion to certain fetishistic behaviors, the story today is mostly about Trump’s tempestuous love affair with the press.
What comes next, however, could be a bigger deal.
Trump, Spicer and Pence were all directing their anger at the press and Buzzfeed in particular. But there is also an undercurrent of Trump’s apparently unresolved feud with the intelligence community.
The president-elect seemed perhaps even angrier with the intelligence agencies for ever touching the embarrassing reports and wondered openly if they were, ahem, leaked intentionally to harm him. If Trump sees the leak as part of his at-times intense feud with the intelligence community over Russia’s role in the 2016 campaign, we could see further escalations soon.
Trump said he accepted the findings that Russia was behind the cyberattacks aimed at Democrats. But that doesn’t apparently mean he’s ready to make nice.
THE RULEBOOK: TEST RESULTS
“It has been observed in a former paper, that ‘the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration.’ …It is not easy to conceive a plan better calculated than this to promote a judicious choice of men for filling the offices of the Union; and it will not need proof, that on this point must essentially depend the character of its administration.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 76
TIME OUT: MITHRIDATES AND THE DEA
The Atlantic: “Martin Shkreli has nothing on Mithridates VI. During his reign (120 to 63 B.C.E.), this king of Pontus (located on the southern edge of the Black Sea) worked as a toxicologist in between waging wars on Rome. His efforts to create a universal antidote helped pave the way for modern drug regulation…Once he became king, Mithridates consulted physicians, scientists, and shamans in the hopes of creating a foolproof remedy to toxins…Mithridates cultivated unique poisons in his laboratories and gardens, and, some historians say, may have even tested them on condemned criminals, in the interest of finding ways to counteract them…Over the next few centuries, recipes for universal antidotes proliferated worldwide…In order to prevent apothecaries from passing off cheap ingredients as expensive ones and poor-quality theriacs (that didn’t adhere to the ‘official’ recipes put forth by medical authorities), as the real thing, city authorities and unions began to oversee production, forming the foundation of modern drug regulation.”

TILLERSON TAKES HARD LINE ON RUSSIA
Fox News: “Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson sought Wednesday to assuage bipartisan concerns about his ties to Russia, testifying at his confirmation hearing he thinks Moscow poses a ‘danger’ and blasting the country’s annexation of Crimea -- though he refused to go so far as to call Vladimir Putin a ‘war criminal’ during a contentious back-and-forth with Sen. Marco Rubio. During the tense exchange at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio persistently questioned Tillerson in an attempt to get him to call Putin a war criminal for Russian military intervention in Syria. Tillerson refused to do so.”
Republicans delay four Trump cabinet hearings - NYT: “Hearings for Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Education; Andrew Puzder, his labor secretary nominee; and Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, Mr. Trump’s pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, have all been pushed back as Democrats clamor for more time to collect and review the standard background checks that nominees traditionally undergo before their hearings commence. Wilbur Ross, Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of commerce, will also be delayed several days because his ethics agreement is not complete, according to the chairman and ranking Democrat of the commerce committee.”
[Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., tells the WaPo he made the decision to testify against Jeff Sessions over the issue of civil rights on the second day of hearings for the attorney general designee.]
McCain says he’s the one that gave Trump accusations on to intel agencies - WashEx: “Arizona Sen. John McCain confirmed he passed along a 35-page report to the FBI that details unverified allegations that President-elect Trump’s team coordinated with the Russian government to defeat Hillary Clinton. In a statement released Wednesday, McCain said passing the report along was the extent of his involvement in the process. ‘Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public,’ McCain said… Reports surfaced Tuesday night that a foreign contact of McCain’s passed along the report detailing alleged compromising information the Russian government has on Trump.”

“Re the discussion of Social Security, we should all remember that it is not a savings plan but a tax. More descriptively, it is a transfer of income from working people to retirees. How else could the government pay benefits at the plan’s inception? In the 80’s the government raised payroll taxes to build a cushion, but that cushion is inexorably deflating due to the continued rise in the ratio of retirees to workers.” – Steve McCardell, Redding, Conn.
[Ed. note: Well, yes, but… Certainly the first recipients of social security were harvesting what amounted to a tax on younger workers. But if Congress had not raided the trust fund with such glee for decades there wouldn’t just be enough money to pay current retirees, there would be a massive surplus. That endless pillaging did, in fact, turn what was intended as a true entitlement into a tax. But that’s not the fault of social security recipients. That’s the fault of lawmakers who have been playing a shell game since the days when cars still had fins on them. You’re also quite right that the Baby Boom will prove to be a bust for social security and Medicare. One thing Millennials are quite right to complain about is the fact that their cohort is likely to get stuck with the bill for their parents’ generation’s benefits.]

MAYBE THE HARE SET HIM UP
KSAT: “SAN ANTONIO – A 150-pound pet tortoise is being blamed for a fire that caused heavy damage to the home of a neighbor on the city’s far Northwest Side. The fire broke out shortly after midnight Tuesday…Firefighters said it appears the tortoise knocked over a heat lamp inside its outdoor cage and started a fire that spread to the home next door. The fire then spread moving into the walls and attic by the time firefighters were able to extinguish it. They said the fire also caused minimal damage to the pet owner’s home. The damage was estimated at $150,000. They said no one was hurt, including the tortoise.”
AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…
“But I think the very fact that this story has surfaced is the way for the CIA to be telling Trump, ‘You mess with us, we have a lot of information. We can mess with you.’” – Charles Krauthamer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”

378,"President-elect Donald Trump never received any summary of unsubstantiated allegations that Russian spies had collected compromising financial and sexual information about him, a highly-placed transition source told Fox News Wednesday.
The source said that intelligence officials who briefed Trump on Friday brought up the allegations verbally, but added that they were ""barely mentioned in passing.""
A government source told Fox News that the intelligence community wanted to give Trump a heads-up that the allegations had been widely circulating and that a lot of media outlets were sitting on the story. The source said the claims did not constitute a ""central element"" of Trump's briefing.
CNN initially reported that Trump and President Barack Obama were presented with a two-page summary that detailed the allegations. The report said the summary was attached to a broader report about Russian operatives' activities during the 2016 election.
At a contentious press conference earlier Wednesday, Trump said that he had learned details of the allegations ""outside of the meeting"" with intelligence officials.
""It's all fake news. It's phony stuff. It didn't happen,"" Trump said, later adding. ""But I read what was released and I think it's a disgrace. I think it's an absolute disgrace.""
Late Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Jake Clapper released a statement saying he had contacted Trump and expressed ""profound dismay"" about the leaks to CNN and Buzzfeed — the latter of which published the unverified allegations in full.
""I emphasized that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC,"" Clapper said. ""The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions.""

379,"At a feisty news conference packed with big announcements, President-elect Donald Trump blasted the media and even the intelligence community Wednesday for “disgraceful” reports about Moscow’s supposed dirt on him – while unveiling a sweeping plan to separate himself from his business empire.
Trump also unveiled his pick for Veterans Affairs Department secretary, vowed to roll out a plan soon to repeal and replace ObamaCare and reiterated his intent to build a border wall.
But he was most animated while rebutting reports that the Russians may have compromising information about him.
“It’s all fake news. It’s phony stuff. It didn’t happen,” Trump said.
Calling the claims “nonsense,” he questioned whether the intelligence community leaked the information. He said it would be a “tremendous blot on their record” if they did and stood by a tweet likening the leak to the tactics of Nazi Germany.
“That’s something that Nazi Germany would have done, and did do,” he said.
Trump said the reports should never have been written, while praising others in the media for their restraint. “I’ve just gone up a notch as to what I think of you,” he quipped.
He later sparred with a reporter from CNN, which along with BuzzFeed first reported on the claims -- though BuzzFeed published the more salacious details.
The crux of the press conference, however, was an announcement from his team about his plans for The Trump Organization -- which now includes handing control of the global company bearing his name to sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, along with chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg.
Trump also plans to resign all offices and positions in his companies, and place his assets and investments in a trust. According to an attorney who spoke at the press conference, daughter Ivanka – whose husband Jared Kushner has accepted a senior adviser job in the White House – will relinquish all management authority as well.
Further, the Trump team announced the organization will donate all profits from foreign government stays at Trump hotels and properties to the U.S. Treasury, and bar foreign deals during his presidency.
The transition team also made clear Trump will not fully divest himself from his business interests, even as he cedes control of the operation. An attorney for The Trump Organization said it was “not realistic” to do so. And Trump plans to retain an ownership interest in the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C., where his new hotel opened last year.
The press conference tackled numerous hot-button topics, from ObamaCare to immigration to his Cabinet.
Addressing one of the few unfilled positions, Trump announced he has chosen David Shulkin to lead the VA. He currently is under secretary for health in the Veterans Affairs Department under the Obama administration.
On the Affordable Care Act, Trump played down deliberations among fellow Republicans about how to proceed on the repeal effort. Without offering specifics, he said his team would submit a plan to repeal and replace the law “almost simultaneously” – “most likely … on the same day or the same week … could be the same hour.”
Trump argued the Republicans would actually be doing Democrats a favor.
“ObamaCare is the Democrats’ problem. We’re going to take the problem off the shelves for them. We’re doing them a tremendous service by doing it,” he said.
The press conference comes at a busy – and tumultuous – time for the president-elect’s transition team. At the same time Trump is finalizing his Cabinet nominations and trying to get them confirmed and in place for the start of his administration, he continues to grapple with reports about Russian interference during the 2016 presidential campaign.
He was briefed last week on intelligence community findings about Russian hacking and other meddling during the campaign that allegedly included the breach and leak of emails from Democratic official accounts. But the story took a salacious turn overnight when it was reported that Trump and President Obama also were briefed on an unverified report Russia had compromising personal and financial information on him.
Both Moscow and the Trump team have vehemently denied the allegations. Trump, further, turned fire on the intelligence community Wednesday morning and blamed them for leaking the details.
Incoming press secretary Sean Spicer also blasted the reports at Wednesday’s press conferece.
“It’s frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog … to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the Internet just days before he takes the oath of office,” he said, referring to BuzzFeed. “The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks.”",neutral
380,"President-elect Donald Trump made one of his final Cabinet appointments on Wednesday, announcing his selection of David J. Shulkin – the top health official in the Department of Veterans Affairs – to lead the struggling agency.
“I have no doubt Dr. Shulkin will be able to lead the turnaround our Department of Veterans Affairs needs. His sole mandate will be to serve our veterans and restore the level of care we owe to our brave men and women in the military,” Trump said in a statement, after revealing his pick at a news conference minutes earlier.
He said Shulkin is “an incredibly gifted doctor who is using his elite talents for medicine to care for our heroes, and Americans can have faith he will get the job done right.”
Shulkin currently serves as under secretary for health at the VA in the Obama administration, a position that is responsible for running the Veterans Health Administration.
President Obama nominated him for that position in March 2015; he was confirmed later that year.
If confirmed for the top job by the Senate, Shulkin would become the first non-veteran to head the department that has been plagued for years by scandals involving mistreatment of veterans.
In May 2014, reports of months-long wait-times for veterans seeking care resulted in the resignation of then-VA secretary Eric Shinseki, who had served in the post since 2009.
Problems with the VA have been documented in numerous reports from the VA Office of Inspector General and the General Accounting Office (GAO) for decades and remain a top concern of lawmakers.
Shulkin, a board-certified internist, has said he believes the VA must implement reforms to the delivery of health care, while maintaining a focus on the veteran.
“VA is at a historic crossroad and will need to make bold reforms that will shape how we deliver IT services and health care in the future, as well as improve the experiences of Veterans, community providers, and VA staff,” he told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee last June.
In addition to his background as a doctor, Shulkin brings a lengthy record of executive experience to the position, having served as president at several medical institutions, including Morristown Medical Center and Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City.",neutral
381,"President-elect Donald Trump resumed his sparring with the press Wednesday at his first post-election news conference -- where he tangled with a CNN journalist over the outlet's reporting on claims the Russians have compromising intel on him.
He attacked the reports as examples of so-called ""fake news,"" and blasted BuzzFeed in particular (the only news outlet to publish the entire dossier) as a “failing pile of garbage.” However, CNN reporter Jim Acosta took issue with Trump’s words directed at both outlets, and called on Trump to let him ask a question.
“Since you’re attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance to ask a question?” he asked.
But Trump wasn’t having it.
“Not you, your news organization is terrible,” Trump replied, and turned to another reporter for a question.
But Acosta kept going, repeatedly shouting to try and get a question in.
“Can you give us a question? You are attacking us, can you give us a question Sir? Sir? Mr. President-elect,” Acosta shouted.
“Quiet. Quiet. She’s asking a question, don’t be rude, don’t be rude,” Trump scolded Acosta, while referring to another questioner.
When Acosta once again sought to ask a question, Trump responded: “No I’m not going to give you a question – you are fake news.”
“No Mr. President-elect, that is not appropriate,” Acosta responded, before giving up.

383,"The Pentagon could be poised for a rapid about-face under the Trump administration, with the Obama administration’s push for social reform surrendering to what could be an old-school emphasis on combat readiness and the spirit of the United States military, experts told FoxNews.com.
Under President Obama, the military sought to integrate transgender persons into the ranks, allow women into special operations forces and purge the nomenclature of gender-specific words, adopting what some critics say was a “politically correct” liberal agenda. That’s a contrast to the traditional U.S. military approach.
In addition, some Navy ships have been named for civil rights activists. And while the Obama administration has taken an inclusive approach on some issues, it has also worked to minimize expressions of Christianity in the ranks. For example, several officers have been disciplined for displaying Bibles or gospel verses in their quarters.
Veterans and military experts told FoxNews.com that, while some of Obama’s civil rights advancements may be locked in, neither Trump nor his choice for secretary of defense, Gen. James “Mad Dog” Mattis, are likely to make social experimentation a priority.
“Here in [the Pentagon], we don’t say merry Christmas, and I think we have been misguided when it comes to our history and who we are as a nation, and political correctness is indicative of that,” Department of Defense contractor and retired Army Col. Robert Maginnis told FoxNews.com.
“It has struck this building in a big way and we need to get away from that. Our focus is defending this country, and we should not spend so much time on social engineering.”
Mattis, who on Thursday goes before the Senate Armed Services Committee as part of his confirmation process, will likely “bring the warrior ethos back to the Pentagon,” Maginnis said.
That mentality was “drained by the Obama administration,” he said. “You need to be known as a good soldier or Marine and not by your sexuality, your gender or your particular faith. We need everyone to pull in the same direction and not espouse a particular personal agenda that doesn’t fit into the nation’s best long-term interest.”
Retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News contributor, said the strong emphasis on social reform in the last eight years sometimes came at the expense of the military’s core objective.
“Social engineering was a distractor from what the main mission of the United States military was about,” Keane said. “We were involved in conflict and war, and these reforms achieved a level of prominence that subordinated the issue of war itself.”
A spokesperson for the outgoing Obama Department of Defense said Pentagon Secretary Ash Carter has “made it clear” that he will let the incoming administration make their own policy decisions, despite disagreements.
“The principle, put simply by Secretary Carter, is that if a service member wants to serve and is qualified to serve, and meets requirements to serve in that position, they should do so, and that is the principle that underlines all of this,” the spokesperson told FoxNews.com. “But it is entirely up to the next Administration and we are focused on ensuring they have all of the support that we can provide to ensure they enjoy a smooth, seamless transition.”
Under a Mattis-led Department of Defense, Maginnis expects the issue of women in combat to be re-visited. One year ago Secretary of Defense Ash Carter opened direct land combat jobs in the infantry and special operations to women.
Last year, Mattis said women should not be in combat because, if they were, the nation’s enemies wouldn’t fear “America’s awesome determination to defend herself.” He said physical standards for combat jobs would become more lax, and women would not have privacy for their “bodily functions.”
In a book on civilian-military relations, co-edited with Kori Schake, Mattis warned of the danger of civilian leaders with a “progressive agenda.” His book also warns that “an uninformed public is permitting political leaders to impose an accretion of social conventions that are diminishing the combat power of our military.”
That’s an opinion Maginnis agrees with.
“Political appointees have a lot of political persuasion,” Maginnis said. “They are essentially political animals kowtowing to their political masters who have an agenda.”
“I think the seriousness Mattis will bring to this building will be translated through every policy we begin to execute,” Maginnis said. “I think he will put a stamp on the organization that will be positive – no more political correctness, just a focus on being warriors.”
In addition to facing the normal confirmation process, Mattis needs a waiver from the legal requirement to have been out of uniform for seven years before accepting a political appointment.
President-elect Trump also appointed Florida Panthers owner and billionaire Vincent Viola as secretary of the Army. Viola, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., achieved the rank of major in the U.S. Army Reserves, but has spent much of his career as one of the nation’s foremost leaders in electronic trading. That career background contrasts to that of current Army Secretary Eric Fanning, most of whose work has been in the public sector and is the first openly gay head of any branch of the U.S. military.",positive

On the Affordable Care Act, Trump played down deliberations among fellow Republicans about how to proceed on the repeal effort. Without offering specifics, he said his team would submit a plan to repeal and replace the law “almost simultaneously” – “most likely … on the same day or the same week … could be the same hour.”
Trump argued the Republicans would actually be doing Democrats a favor.
“ObamaCare is the Democrats’ problem. We’re going to take the problem off the shelves for them. We’re doing them a tremendous service by doing it,” he said.
The press conference comes at a busy – and tumultuous – time for the president-elect’s transition team. At the same time Trump is finalizing his Cabinet nominations and trying to get them confirmed and in place for the start of his administration, he continues to grapple with reports about Russian interference during the 2016 presidential campaign.
He was briefed last week on intelligence community findings about Russian hacking and other meddling during the campaign that allegedly included the breach and leak of emails from Democratic official accounts. But the story took a salacious turn overnight when it was reported that Trump and President Obama also were briefed on an unverified report Russia had compromising personal and financial information on him.
Both Moscow and the Trump team have vehemently denied the allegations. Trump, further, turned fire on the intelligence community Wednesday morning and blamed them for leaking the details.
Incoming press secretary Sean Spicer also blasted the reports at Wednesday’s press conferece.
“It’s frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog … to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the Internet just days before he takes the oath of office,” he said, referring to BuzzFeed. “The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks.”",neutral
386,"During the Trump administration, the Office of the First Lady is reportedly going to be changed to the Office of the First Family. It may signal the emergence of dual administration roles for the two most important women in Trump's life: daughter Ivanka and soon-to-be First Lady, Melania.
""She has the potential to be the next Jacqueline Kennedy,"" said Andy Och, author of ""Unusual for Their Time: On the Road with America's First Ladies.""
""She’s a high fashion icon, a business woman. She's involved with philanthropic and charitable endeavors,"" he added.
Melania will bring an uncommon background to the White House. She is the second First Lady born outside the U.S. and the first born in a formerly Communist country. She is fluent in five languages: her native Slovenian, Serbian, French, German and English. In addition, she’s the first to have been a super model and the first to pose nude.
TRUMP’S TEAM: WHO’S WHO IN PRESIDENT-ELECT’S CABINET, WHITE HOUSE
Her decision to stay in New York through the first months of the administration is based on her desire to be with her 10-year-old son, Barron, who will finish the school year there.
A second factor may be her discomfort in the political sphere. Her first major foray into it - the speech at the GOP Convention - ended with findings of plagiarism. She largely retreated from campaign speaking after that but denied in an October interview with Fox News's Ainsley Earhardt that it was because of the speech. ""My priorities are with my son, and I want to be a mother first,"" she said.
Melania's partial withdrawal from campaigning coincided with First Daughter Ivanka's rise. She announced Wednesday her leave of absence from The Trump Organization as well as from her apparel and accessories business. Her reported intention at the White House is to help level the playing field for female entrepreneurs and job creators.
Whoever occupies the Office of the First Family will find a powerful new bully pulpit, said Amy Zantzinger, a former White House social secretary for Laura Bush.
""Because it is a podium with a very, very loud voice. And any first lady when they arrive, I don't think they have any idea about how loud that voice can be,"" she said.
Melania promises not to shy away from it, no matter how intense the incoming fire. ""You know, I'm very strong, I'm very confident, and I could handle everything,"" she told Earhardt.
Both Ivanka and Melania have expressed a desire to protect the interests of children. Ivanka has already spent time telephoning members of Congress to build support for tax free child care accounts and child care deductions for those making under $500,000 a year.",negative
387,"The selling of Jeff Sessions as attorney general began before his fellow senators began questioning him yesterday.
Through a series of calculated leaks, the Trump transition team tried to combat the lingering image problem from the Senate’s rejection of him for a judgeship—a story I covered decades ago.
The Trump strategists made sure that the Washington Post and New York Times had an advance copy of the Alabama senator’s opening statement.
That produced this headline, invaluable to the pro-confirmation forces: “Sessions to press image of tough lawman and independent voice at attorney general hearings.”
“As he seeks to convince his colleagues he is worthy of being the next U.S. attorney general,” the Post story began, “Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) will cast himself as an old-school law enforcer who will crack down on violent crime, work to improve morale at local police departments and remain fiercely independent of the president who appointed him, according to a copy of prepared remarks he will make at his confirmation hearing that begins Tuesday.”
The story also had Sessions asserting his independence by saying the AG “must be willing to tell the president ‘no’ if he overreaches” and “cannot be a mere rubber stamp.”
A separate leak to Politico included the opening remarks of Susan Collins, who would introduce Sessions and is a key supporter as the Senate’s most moderate Republican:
“We have worked closely on some issues and on opposite sides on others. In fact, it would be fair to say that we have had our share of vigorous debates and policy disagreements. I can confidently vouch for the fact that Jeff Sessions is a person of integrity, a principled leader, and a dedicated public servant.""
The Times had a somewhat sympathetic profile: “Jeff Sessions, a Lifelong Outsider, Finds the Inside Track”:
“Mr. Sessions is in many ways Mr. Trump’s antithesis: reedy-voiced, diminutive and mild-mannered, a devout Methodist and an Eagle Scout who will soon celebrate a golden wedding anniversary with his college sweetheart.”
Once the hearing was under way, Sessions provided the day's major headline by saying he would recuse himself from any investigation involving Hillary Clinton because he had criticized her and her private server as a Trump supporter during the campaign. That came in the opening sequence with GOP Chairman Chuck Grassley and was probably planned. Sessions also sought to disarm his liberal detractors by saying he regarded past court rulings on abortion and same-sex marriage as the law of the land.
When the Senate heard testimony in 1986 that Sessions, then a federal prosecutor, had said racially insensitive things and called the NAACP and ACLU “un-American,” it was hard to imagine that he would one day be the nominee for attorney general (or that Donald Trump, then a year away from publishing “The Art of the Deal,” would be president).
But the courtly Sessions got himself elected to the Senate, and as a well-liked member of the exclusive club, will have little trouble being confirmed.
Sessions is a staunchly conservative pick who will have a far different approach, especially on civil rights and immigration, than the Justice Department of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. He has said the Voting Rights Act is intrusive but necessary.
But Sessions defenders are making sure the press knows that he once prosecuted two KKK members for murdering a black teenager, and that he co-sponsored legislation to award congressional gold medals to Rosa Parks and Alabama civil rights marchers.
None of this happens by accident. Sarah Flores, a strategist for Carly Fiorina’s campaign who is now working on the nomination, told USA Today that they had held several mock sessions to prepare for hostile questions by Democratic members.
Given that the hearing was televised, the process is as important as the outcome. The goal of the Trump team was not just for the nominee to avoid land mines but to burnish his image a bit after a barrage of negative publicity. By working the press, these strategists are trying to change the narrative that sunk Jeff Sessions 30 years ago.",negative

After it was reported that Sen. John McCain originally forwarded the documents to the FBI last year, the Arizona Republican senator confirmed Wednesday he had given “sensitive” documents to the bureau – but said he has no sense of their authenticity.

390,"Ivanka Trump plans to step aside from her executive roles at the Trump Organization and her lifestyle brand, but says she is confident both businesses will continue to ""thrive.""
In a post on her Facebook page Wednesday, Ivanka Trump said she would take a ""formal leave of absence"" from her executive positions at the Trump Organization and her lifestyle brand — which offers shoes, clothes and messages of female empowerment.
President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would put control of his company in the hands of his sons and an executive, put his business assets in a trust and take other steps to isolate himself from his business.
Ivanka Trump said her company will be run by the current president and a board of trustees. For now, she is not taking a role in her father's administration, but her husband Jared Kushner will serve as a senior advisor.
IVANKA TRUMP, CHILDREN, HARASSED BY HILLARY SUPPORTER ON JETBLUE FLIGHT
As the family moves to Washington, Ivanka Trump said she will be focused on getting her three children settled. But she also stressed her ongoing interest in issues affecting women and girls and said she would seek to determine the ""most impactful and appropriate ways for me to serve our country.""
The Trump team has said Ivanka Trump will divest some assets and will receive fixed payments rather than a share of the profits from the Trump Organization. She will also not be involved in the company's Washington hotel. No details have been released on her financial arrangement with the lifestyle brand.
Transition officials also said Kushner will recuse himself from any matters impacting the Trump Organization. Richard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics counselor for President George W. Bush, said separation will be key because ""all of her assets and income are attributable to him.""
JARED KUSHNER JOINS FATHER-IN-LAW'S WHITE HOUSE AS SENIOR ADVISER
Painter added that if Ivanka Trump continues to have a financial stake in her business, then Kushner must recuse himself from areas that impact it, like foreign trade.
Ivanka Trump's independent lifestyle brand promotes her image as a successful working mother and partners with companies to make the branded blush pink dresses and trendy booties offered in department stores.
Just how successful the business will be without her actively involved is not clear. Brand licensing expert Michael Stone, chairman of the agency Beanstalk, said that celebrity-driven brands succeed best when consumers aspire to be like the personality and believe the person is involved with the developing the products.
""I don't know if just being a role model is enough to drive a product brand,"" he said.
He also noted that it takes time to develop a personal brand to the point that it survives without the person involved, like with Paul Newman's Newman's Own products or Perry Ellis fashion. While Ivanka Trump has been successful, she does not have that kind of longevity in the marketplace.
""Is it going to fail completely, I doubt it,"" said Stone. ""But will it have the (same) growth curve?""",positive

Liberal PAC American Bridge, launched by Clinton ally David Brock, on Wednesday announced the leadership team for a new anti-Trump project called the “Trump War Room.” The group tapped Shripal Shah, a former Clinton campaign staffer and alumnus of the Democratic National Committee, to run the outfit.
“The Trump War Room is set to be the research and communications powerhouse that will fight Trump at every turn,” American Bridge said in a statement.
“The Trump War Room will continue to put a spotlight on all the different ways that Trump’s decisions are driven not by the national interests of the American people, but by Trump’s own personal self-interests that could put our national security in jeopardy.”
The project also has added former Clinton campaign official Emily Aden, who will be the Trump War Room’s director of rapid response, the announcement said. Aden was deputy research director for the Clinton campaigns in 2008 and 2016.
Brock announced in December he was going to launch the project, saying in a press release that “while Trump may be president-elect, he definitively does not have a mandate.”
Trump supporters for weeks have accused Clinton backers and the Democratic National Committee of being sore losers, amid new efforts aimed at opposing the incoming administration.
Dawn Le, spokesperson for American Bridge, told FoxNews.com the project would consist of research on Trump’s statements and policies, as well as video tracking and a rapid-response operation.
“There’s a lot of concern about the Trump administration and what it will mean for our civil rights, civil liberties, and whether he will be using his presidency for profit for himself, his family and his business,” Le said.
Asked if the project aims to undermine Trump, and not accept that he was elected, Le said American Bridge “understands that he’s been elected president.”
“When the inauguration begins, he will take office, there’s no denying that,” she said, adding: “It not a secret that people who work at American Bridge wanted Hillary Clinton to be president.”

393,"President-elect Donald Trump is reviving long debunked attempts to link vaccines to autism, meeting with a vocal skeptic to discuss chairing a commission on vaccination safety -- a move that alarmed child health experts.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday, and told reporters that he had agreed to lead the effort, whatever form it takes.
""President-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies and he has questions about it,"" Kennedy said, adding that ""we ought to be debating the science.""
To pediatricians, there's nothing left to debate.
""Vaccines have been part of the fabric of our society for decades and are the most significant medical innovation of our time,"" Drs. Fernando Stein and Karen Remley of the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement Tuesday.
Scientists have ruled out a link between vaccines and autism. But Kennedy, the son of the late U.S. attorney general and senator, has long argued that vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal may cause autism, and has advocated for parents to more easily opt out of childhood vaccinations.
Trump also has voiced vaccine skepticism, on Twitter and during one of the primary debates when he said that autism has gotten ""totally out of control."" In that debate he went on to say, ""I am totally in favor of vaccines, but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.""
A Trump spokeswoman said late Tuesday that while he ""enjoyed"" his conversation with Kennedy, he had not yet commissioned a panel.
""The president-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time,"" said Hope Hicks.
Those are views unsupported by scientific evidence and dismissed as conspiracy theory by experts who find their revival alarming. Vaccination prevents millions of deaths around the world each year. Once common childhood killers can return if support for immunization wanes: During a 2015 measles outbreak that started at Disneyland, many who fell ill were unvaccinated.
Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no evidence that vaccines in general or those with thimerosal cause autism. That preservative has been removed from routine childhood immunizations; while it remains in some flu vaccines, there are thimerosal-free versions.
""The science has spoken. Thimerosal is a dead issue,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a critic of anti-vaccine groups. ""It is concerning. You have as a president-elect a science denialist.""
Beyond thimerosal, research has discredited concerns that children get too many vaccines at once.
""Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease,"" said Stein and Remley of the pediatricians' group. It's not just children who gain, they noted: Widespread vaccination lowers the spread of disease that also threatens the elderly or people with weak immune systems.
lt's not clear what Kennedy described as a ""commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity"" would do.

396,"I strongly disagree with Donald Trump: I think Meryl Streep is the finest actress of her generation.
I also wish she hadn’t used her Golden Globes platform to become the latest Hollywood type to bash Donald Trump.
Whether it’s the cast of “Hamilton” or a celeb video urging obstruction of the new president or now the woman receiving the Cecil B. DeMille award, these performers are playing to their base. They seem to willfully reject the fact that we just had a hard-fought election and their preferred candidate lost.
More fundamentally, whether it’s actors or singers or NFL quarterbacks, I think the country is growing weary of political diatribes being injected into entertainment events. They have every right to speak out, of course, but to do it before a mass audience tuning in for an awards show feels a little bit like hijacking the event.
And, of course, if the president-elect responds, he’s depicted as a bully in liberal quarters. The banner headline in yesterday’s Huffington Post: “TRUMP LASHES OUT AT MERYL: ‘HILLARY LOVER.’”
Doesn’t “lash out” suggest you’re striking the first blow?
Now Streep was undeniably a Hillary Clinton supporter; she introduced her at the Democratic convention. And she’s hardly some empty-headed teenage pop idol. So she began with a defense of Hollywood, saying it was composed of people from across the country, like her home state of New Jersey.
Then came the not-naming-him-but-everyone-knows-who-I-mean part:
“There was one performance this year that stunned me,” she said. “It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good. There was nothing good about it. But it was effective, and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth.
“It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it. I still can’t get it out of my head because it wasn’t in a movie. It was real life.”
Streep was referring, obviously, to the accusation that Trump mocked disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has limited use of his arms, after Kovaleski said an article he wrote after 9/11 did not support the claim that thousands of Muslims had celebrated on New Jersey rooftops. Trump denied that he was making fun of the reporter’s disability as he did a jerking-around imitation of him; it was not his finest hour.
Streep revived the 2015 episode to paint a dark portrait of Trump: “And this instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, ’cause it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing.”
Trump, not one to let such attacks pass, tweeted that Streep is “one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood” and “a Hillary flunky who lost big.” In a late-night phone call with a New York Times reporter, Trump said he wasn’t surprised at being chastised by “liberal movie people,” adding: “I was never mocking anyone. I was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story.”
Streep also had a message for the media: “We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call him on the carpet for every outrage.”
Now I fully endorse the first part, about the press holding politicians accountable. The second part--""every outrage""--is obviously a partisan slam that assumes there will be endless outrages.
I’d offer a brief reminder that Trump hasn’t even taken office yet. Are we looking at four years in which most of the entertainment community—and part of the media—will entrench themselves in an anti-Trump opposition camp?
Imagine the Golden Globes of 2009, if, say, Phil Robertson of someone from ""Duck Dynasty"" had used the occasion to rip Barack Obama. Wouldn't there be howls of media outrage about how inappropriate that was? Yet I haven't seen much of that in the press when it comes to Streep.
I guess the notion of giving a new president a chance, whether you supported him or not, is hopelessly quaint. I didn’t like it any better when some conservatives dug into immediate opposition against Obama and vowed to “take our country back,” as if he hadn’t been properly elected in 2008.
The Streep story has gone viral, deflecting attention from the spate of Trump nominees getting their confirmation hearings this week. Mitch McConnell has been noting that the Republicans cooperated in confirming seven Obama nominees as he took office, but conveniently forgetting his demand that they first had to submit their financial disclosures, which he has now dropped.

“He is going to build that wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it,” she said. “That has not changed.”
It remains unclear how the Trump administration would compel Mexico to pay, as America’s southern neighbor has shown no intention of doing so. In the near-term, the push to rely on existing law authorizing a border fence could stave off a legislative fight that Trump might lose if he tried to get Congress to pass a measure authorizing the kind of border wall he promised during the campaign.
But whatever steps might be taken without Congress' approval would be likely to fall short of the extravagant new wall on the border that Trump repeatedly said Mexico would pay for during his campaign.
Still, several lawmakers and congressional officials said the administration could have significant flexibility in taking additional steps without Congress' approval.
""There's a lot of things that can be done within current law,"" said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., a longtime proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, though he emphasized that a lasting solution on immigration would take action by Congress. ""You cannot minimize the potential impact of the administration doing what they can do under the law,"" he said.
Trump's vow to build an impenetrable, concrete wall along the southern border was his signature campaign proposal. ""Build the wall!"" supporters would chant at his rallies. ""Who's going to pay for it?"" Trump would ask them. ""Mexico!"" Trump often promised the wall would be built of hardened concrete, rebar and steel as tall as his venues' ceilings, and would feature a ""big, beautiful door"" to allow legal immigrants to enter.
Most experts viewed such promises as unrealistic and impractical, and Trump himself sometimes allowed that the wall would not need to span the entire length of the border, thanks to natural barriers like rivers. After winning the election, he said he'd be open to stretches of fencing.

399,"A declassified U.S. intelligence report released Friday directly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering a campaign to influence the U.S. election and hurt Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – findings made public after officials briefed President-elect Donald Trump.
The report said:
“We assess with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”

The intelligence report said this campaign included cyber activity and other efforts.
The report adds fresh fuel to the debate over Russia’s involvement in email hacking that affected Democratic groups during the 2016 race. Trump has publicly questioned the evidence linking Russia and, hours before his briefing on Friday, called the focus a “political witch hunt.”
However, Trump and the intelligence community seemed to find some common ground after the briefing. Both Trump and the report said the Russians did not target vote tallying.
Trump, in a statement, went a step further and said “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.”
The report did not make an assessment on the impact on the election outcome.
While some have used the claims of Russian meddling to question the validity of Trump’s victory – including in a failed protest on the House floor during the certification of the Electoral College tally Friday – House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement that “Donald Trump won this election fair and square.”
Still, the report lays out in new and alarming detail an alleged influence campaign stemming from Moscow, which Ryan and others condemned.
The report said that included cyber activity, as well as efforts by state-funded media and paid social media “trolls.” The report said Russian intelligence services conducted cyber operations against both major U.S. parties, and said they have “high confidence” Russian military intelligence used Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.com to release “US victim data” publicly and to the media, “and relayed material to WikiLeaks.”
WikiLeaks famously published emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta last year. Founder Julian Assange, however, told Fox News this past week that Russia was not his source.
The intelligence report was declassified in the wake of Obama administration sanctions and other retaliation against the Russian government late last month. The unclassified version included footnotes acknowledging that it ""does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign."" But it said its conclusions were identical to the classified version.
The report said Russian intelligence got access to DNC networks in July 2015 and maintained that access until at least June 2016. Despite past suggestions from Clinton allies that some leaked emails might be inauthentic, the report also noted that, “Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.”
The report also said: “Moscow’s approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on Russia’s understanding of the electoral prospects of the two main candidates. When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency.”
In a statement issued shortly before the release of the report, Trump stressed his regard for the intelligence community: “I had a constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the Intelligence Community this afternoon. I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation.”
But the allegations have been the subject of fierce debate in Washington, especially among Republicans.
GOP lawmakers like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have essentially accepted the accusations against Russia, while Trump and his allies have cast doubt on them or suggested they were meant to discredit him.
In his written statement, Trump acknowledged that Russia, China and others “are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee” – but said “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome.”
Trump also said the U.S. needs to fight and stop cyberattacks, and he’ll appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days of taking office. “Two weeks from today I will take the oath of office and America’s safety and security will be my number one priority,” he said.
Before the briefing, Trump continued to raise concerns about the intel being used for political purposes. He told The New York Times he doesn’t want other countries hacking the U.S., but said the attention on Russia’s alleged actions stems from those who “got beaten very badly in the election” and “are very embarrassed.”
Following on complaints about how the intelligence findings have been portrayed in the media, he even tweeted that he’s asked congressional committee leaders to “investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.”
In another twist, following reports that the FBI never accessed the Democratic National Committee’s servers as part of their probe, a senior FBI official told Fox News the bureau did in fact ask – and was denied.
“The FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,” the official said. “This left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier.”

402,"A joint session of Congress on Friday formally certified President-elect Donald Trump’s Electoral College victory, over the last-minute objections of several Democratic lawmakers who tried to contest the outcome – and were instructed by Vice President Biden, “It is over.”
The certification clears away any final hurdles for Trump’s road to the inauguration in two weeks.
Trump was certified as winning the White House race with 304 electoral votes to Hillary Clinton’s 227. Mike Pence was certified as the next vice president.
But as with other formalities in this election that normally would proceed without much ado, Friday’s certification was marked by moments of drama.
Several Democratic lawmakers tried to sideline the proceedings, objecting to the validity of the vote on the basis of what they called “voter suppression,” Russian interference in the election, and other factors.
Each time, Biden, who was presiding, rapped the gavel and cut them off because they did not have the necessary support for their objection from a U.S. senator.
“It is over,” Biden instructed Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., one of several who tried to lodge an objection. The chamber broke out in applause.
Toward the end, several protesters also were escorted out of the House chambers.
The outcome already was assured, after all 538 electors met in their respective state capitals in December to cast their votes, giving Trump well over the 270 needed to win. Despite rumblings of a revolt, only two Republican electors -- both from Texas -- cast protest votes that day for someone other than Trump. Clinton lost four Democratic electors in Washington state and one in Hawaii.
Friday's vote count marked the last chance for Democrats and other anti-Trump forces to disrupt Trump's election. They technically were allowed to file objections, but needed a member of the House and Senate to jointly contest an individual state’s electoral ballots, in order to trigger a separate debate and vote.
None of the House Democrats objecting had a Senate co-sponsor.
The scene was reminiscent of 2001, when various members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) tried to challenge Florida’s electoral slate from the previous fall’s disputed election. Then-Vice President Gore repeatedly asked each CBC member if they had a Senate sponsor to jointly contest the slate. None did.
“I don’t care that it is not signed by a senator,” Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., famously proclaimed.
“The chair would advise that the rules do care,” Gore chastened Waters as he rejected her petition.
The response from Gore, who as the 2000 Democratic nominee was the person who stood to benefit from a successful challenge, triggered applause from congressional Republicans in the House chamber.
This year, the most Democrats could do was slow the process as they didn’t have the votes to overturn the outcome.
Trump won the election even though Clinton received nearly 2.9 million more votes. The Democratic nominee’s popular-vote victory, combined with post-election claims from the intelligence community that Moscow engaged in computer hacking to sway the election in favor of Trump, had fueled last month’s failed effort to stall Trump’s election in the Electoral College.
But Trump has cast doubt on those findings, while taking some final swipes at Clinton as he prepares for the inauguration.
He tweeted Friday morning, “Hillary and the Dems were never going to beat the PASSION of my voters. They saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the...... and knew they were in big trouble - which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minute.THEY SAW A MOVEMENT LIKE NEVER BEFORE.”
The congressional certification comes as Trump has named nominees for most of his Cabinet positions and is filling out his White House staff.

403,"Democratic lawmakers, immigration activists and Obama administration officials are demanding that personal information that more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants provided to the U.S. government when they applied for a special program that spared them from deportation not be used against them in the future.
Supporters of the immigrants, who are part of a program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, say the Obama administration succeeded in persuading those who applied for it to come out of the shadows by reassuring them that doing so would not backfire and get them deported.
They plan to call for a hands-off approach to DACA recipients – who were brought to the U.S. illegally as minors – at a rally in Washington D.C., as well as about a dozen cities nationwide – on Jan. 14. Some Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Luis Gutierrez, of Illinois, plan to speak at the rally.
“There are two competing philosophies here,” Gutierrez, one of the most vocal supporters of undocumented immigrants in Congress, said to FoxNews.com in a statement. “One that says the immigrants are here and will probably be here for the rest of their lives, so we want them to be on the books, working with permission.”
“The other philosophy is to make people scared to come forward even when they are complying with the law,” he said. “It could have a chilling effect in the future, so there should be a firewall between information submitted for one situation being used in a completely different context.”
On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson joined the fray by insisting that the data the DACA recipients provided when they applied for the program, which President Barack Obama established in 2012 through an executive order, not be used for immigration enforcement.
Johnson’s warning came as Reuters reported that the Trump transition team sought information from the Homeland Security Department about Obama’s executive actions on immigration. Reuters noted that Trump has made specific reference to DACA as one of several executive orders he plans to eliminate.
Proponents of stricter immigration enforcement say that Obama never should have issued the executive order giving what they view as amnesty to a mass group of people. And so, they argue, demands that the information not be used to enforce immigration laws are preposterous.
Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican who favors a hard line on immigration and has been a long-time member of the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, wants the Trump administration to get rid of DACA, and views it absurd for federal agents not to be able to use information at their disposal to enforce the law.
“DACA is flat-out unconstitutional,” King said to FoxNews.com “You can’t have a president announce that a huge class of people are exempt from the application of the law.”
Immigrants here legally who were brought to the country as children have been at the center of some of the most emotional debates about illegal immigration.
Their supporters say they are here illegally through no fault of their own, and that they should not be punished for decisions that their parents made. Some Republicans, including those who favor strict immigration laws, say they sympathize with that argument.
“Secretary Johnson’s commitment to protecting [young immigrants] from deportation is admirable, as is the work done by DHS and this administration to protect and support immigrants,” said Rep. Judy Chu in a statement. “However...our concerns are with the actions of the incoming president who has expressly run against norms and precedent.”
Chu and several other Democrats want Obama to issue an executive order precluding the use of the DACA recipients’ information for deportation matters.
“Without such a legal assurance,” she said, “immigrants who believed our promise of security are left to the devices of President-elect Trump who has repeatedly promised to be a deporter-in-chief.”
Trump has at times expressed sympathy for immigrants brought here as children, indicating there should be some humane way to address their situation.
Some Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio, of Florida, has said that the least politically explosive way to do away with DACA may be to phase it out, with the hope that Congress can develop more permanent solutions to fixing the immigration system through legislation.
But others say that to give these immigrants a break amounts to rewarding their parents’ violation of U.S. laws, and sends the wrong message. In some cases, immigrants who have come forward to apply for legal status – such as through political asylum -- or another benefit have been subjected to deportation if their petition is declined or expires.
In other cases, certain U.S. agencies, such as those that collect complaints about wage and hour violations, and the Census Bureau, do not share information provided by undocumented immigrants with immigration authorities. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would purge information about undocumented immigrants from government databases it were to be used for enforcement, but some experts have said such a move would be illegal.
“Everything I do on the issue of immigration comes back to restoring the rule of law,” King said, adding that he thinks that DACA recipients and others who came illegally as minors should be subject to deportation.
“It’s egregiously offensive to the integrity of the American people to give them a path that they legally didn’t have a right to have,” King said.
Many DACA recipients, who had to meet strict criteria to qualify for the program, say they are worried they will be penalized for heeding the Obama administration’s call to come forward.
They say they feel a greater bond to the United States than to their parents’ homeland, one that many don’t remember
“I’ve been in the United States so long, everything big that has happened to me in my life happened to me here,” said Monica Camacho, a 22-year-old Maryland resident who came to the United States at the age of 7 from Mexico. “We are in the [U.S. government] system. Are we going to be deported? Will our parents be deported?”
“This is my home,” she said of the United States. “I want to be an elementary school teacher here. We want to contribute to the economy. We are not bad people, we love this country.”
Many critics of Obama’s immigration executive action say that even if the Trump administration were to obtain the information of DACA recipients, it is unlikely to move to deport them any time soon.
Trump has said his priority would be to track down and deport dangerous criminals and national security threats.
“They’re going to have their hands full trying to restructure immigration enforcement,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors strict enforcement. “Illegal aliens are all over the place, [immigration agents] don’t need to go after DACA recipients” specifically to crack down on illegal immigration.
Krikorian said that major immigration matters, such as border security, and chain family migration, must be fixed before hardliners in Congress would consider a measure giving special consideration to a path for legal status for immigrants who came as children.
“For people who came here and spent their entire schooling here, then sure,” Krikorian said of some kind of amnesty for them, “but cleaning up that mess that Obama created has to be in exchange for something.”",negative

Trump was elected president on a promise to better enforce the country's immigration laws and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to keep illegal immigrants out. It was part of his broader pitch to look out for American interests first, on everything from trade and jobs to foreign policy and national security.
""To all the politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today,"" Trump said in a major immigration policy speech after winning the Republican presidential nomination last year.

406,"A task force of bipartisan lawmakers on Thursday released a report recommending a detailed cybersecurity agenda for the incoming Trump administration, even as the issue dominates talk on Capitol Hill.
The panel, co-chaired by House Homeland Security Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse. D-R.I., released the 34-page report in a press conference in which they outlined the top priorities for preventing foreign hacks of sensitive data.
“A silent war is waged against us in cyber space –if we don’t shape it, it will be shaped against us,” McCaul said. “Every person in this room is a target and the phones in your pocket ar the battle space –and the enemy is winning.”
The Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) sponsored the CSIS Cyber Policy Task Force, which produced the report. A similar report was presented to then President-elect Barack Obama in 2009, and compiled by a commission also served by McCaul.
Although Trump has expressed skepticism aboutthe U.S. intelligence community's claim that Russia was behind hacks that may have influenced the election, there is reason to believe his team will take heed of the task force's report. Co-chair and former national director of U.S. Cyber Challenge Karen Evans, who was on the task force from its inception, is now a member of the Trump transition team.
“We have given the report to the transition team at their request,” CSIS Senior Vice President James Lewis told FoxNews.com. “There are issues I know they are particularly interested in, so we will get traction in those areas.”
McCaul said cybersecurity must never become a partisan issue and called for a major reorganization and consolidation of domestic civilian cyber defense efforts into a single, strong cybersecurity agency at the Department of Homeland Security.
Whitehouse agreed that a single specialized office could attract world class talent and improve cyber security measures.
Lewis said a review of DHS by the task force determined that as little as 2 percent of its budget went to the department’s cybersecurity division.
“If the Trump administration is going to be serious about this, they need to give DHS the focus and resources to make cybersecurity a primary concern,” Lewis said. “The transition team holds their cards close to their vest, but I’m confident they’ll pick up the ball from where it’s been left on the field and run with it—I think that’s a good thing.”
The task force, Sen. Whitehouse urged, also strongly recommends the appointment of a new cybersecurity coordinator, and the push to elevate the position to assistant to the President.
The press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday convened at the same time as the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on Russian hacks.
“The President-elect wants stronger relationships with Russia and to change the dynamics we have with Russia,” McCaul said during the press conference. “There are radical Islamist forces that will perhaps be more aggressive in attacks against Russia and I think it is an opportunity for us to work with them, but Russia is not our friend – [President Vladimir] Putin is not our friend.”
But one former operator within the NSA and current CEO of Soteria, Chris O’Rourke, a small cybersecurity firm based in Charleston, S.C., told FoxNews.com the government needs to create a better pipeline to share information to smaller firms with budgetary restrictions.
“The reason policies have failed under the Obama administration is because they made it somewhat of a ‘big boy club,’ a pay-to-play operation, but the innovation is in the smaller cyber security companies,” O’Rourke said, noting smaller agencies are filled with former federal cybersecurity operatives. “We are former hackers fighting hackers.""",positive

""We've got to make sure that during this transition period that there is a seamless passing of the baton, that there's continuity,"" Obama said. He said it was critical to ensure that ""we are doing everything we can to make sure that the next president will benefit from the same kinds of outstanding advice and service that these people around the table have provided me.""
Obama's comments as he sat down with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the military's combatant commanders came amid concerns in military and diplomatic circles about how Trump may handle national security challenges. Over the last few days, Trump has disputed the U.S. intelligence community's assessments about Russian hacking, insisted without explanation that North Korea won't develop a nuclear weapon that could hit the U.S. and questioned the worth of the United Nations.
Obama pointed to a handful of conflicts that Trump will inherit when he takes office on Jan. 20, including the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria and in the Iraqi city of Mosul, the biggest IS stronghold in Iraq and last major Iraqi city where the extremist group still has control. He also noted that the conflict in Afghanistan ""is still active.""
In praising the military, Obama appeared to call attention to traditions that Democrats are most concerned that Trump may not uphold. Trump has nominated retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis for defense secretary despite the prohibition on recently departed military members running the civilian-led Pentagon, and at one point in the campaign, Trump called for reinstating waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques.
Obama said he was optimistic about the country's future because the military upholds ""the values of rule of law and professionalism and integrity, and recognizes our constitutional structure and maintains strict adherence and respect for civilian authority and democratic practices in determining how we use the awesome force of the American military.""
The president was also honored at a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, a short drive from the White House.
Addressing a room of men and women from the various branches of the military, Obama praised their service and sacrifice. He said there is ""no greater privilege and no greater honor"" than serving as commander in chief.
""As I reflect on the challenges we have faced together and on those to come, I believe that one of the greatest tasks before our armed forces is to retain the high confidence that the American people rightly place in you,"" Obama said. ""We must never hesitate to act when necessary to defend our nation, but we must also never rush into war because sending you into harm's way should be a last and not first resort.""

409,"The media have a message for Donald Trump and the Republicans as they prepare to take over the federal machinery:
“It’s put-up or shut-up time.”
That is literally the lead of a New York Times news story on the GOP controlling the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time since 2006.
But that blunt line does capture a harsh reality of Beltway life, which is that it’s hard for even the majority party to get things done. The Democrats discovered this in 2009, and the Republicans face similar obstacles in 2017.
The House GOP got off to an awful start by secretly agreeing to weaken the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which investigates complaints against lawmakers of both parties.
Talk about terrible optics. The caucus took this move over the objections of its top leaders, Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy, and quickly took flak from Donald Trump.
“With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it … may be, their number one act and priority,” the president-elect tweeted. In the face of a media outcry, the House Republicans quickly rescinded their vote.
This was a reminder that Trump ran against the Republican establishment, with little Hill support, and may be at odds with its members on some very fundamental issues.
Congressional Republicans want to immediately repeal ObamaCare. Trump’s position is that the entire program shouldn’t be junked without an alternative system that would prevent millions from losing their insurance. So we could wind up with a repeal that doesn’t take effect for a long time, maybe years.
Ryan wants to revamp and partially privatize Medicare, but Trump has said repeatedly—including to me—that there should be no changes to the program’s benefits.
What’s more, party unity ain’t what it used to be. As one GOP lawmaker told me, they are all independent contractors.
From tax cuts to a big infrastructure program to dealing with Russia, the Republicans will have to resolve their internal divisions while also dealing with the Democrats.
Chuck Schumer’s party may slow-walk some nominations as payback for the GOP not acting on Merrick Garland, and in reality it takes 60 Senate votes to pass much of anything.
The truth is, it’s easier being the opposition party. As the Times piece points out, “Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them. Now, if they can assemble the votes, their ideas will become law — with all the attendant consequences.”
For all the potential roadblocks, Trump just won an extremely contentious election. Even with his lower-than-usual approval numbers, he will dominate the national discourse. So Republicans will be under tremendous pressure to deliver what the new president wants—and acutely aware that they will be blamed for any failures.

410,"California lawmakers already are preparing for a legal brawl with the Donald Trump administration – and they’ve got President Obama’s former top attorney in their corner.
Top state Democratic lawmakers announced Wednesday that former Attorney General Eric Holder has been tapped as outside counsel to advise the Legislature on potential challenges with the Trump government. He will lead a team from the Covington & Burling law firm, where he’s been working since leaving the Obama administration in 2015.
“With the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead,” California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement. “This is a critical moment in the history of our nation. We have an obligation to defend the people who elected us and the policies and diversity that make California an example of what truly makes our nation great.”
They said Holder and his team will advise “in our efforts to resist any attempts to roll back the progress California has made.”
The statement did not specify which policies they anticipate will cause friction, though California’s numerous sanctuary cities are likely to face challenges from an administration that has threatened to pull their federal funding.
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, De León suggested Holder’s team will work on issues like immigration, climate change, the environment and voting rights.
The unorthodox arrangement assigns to Holder’s team some duties that normally would be handled by the state’s top law enforcement official, the California attorney general. Gov. Jerry Brown has nominated Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra for that job.
The Los Angeles Times reported that De León and Rendon have been considering hiring outside counsel ever since Trump’s election, in a preemptive bid to protect state policies that could clash with the new administration’s.
Holder was one of Obama’s longest-serving and most controversial Cabinet members.
He had a contentious relationship with congressional Republicans, who in 2012 voted to hold him in contempt of Congress for not turning over documents on the Fast and Furious “gun-walking” scandal.
He left in 2015 to rejoin Covington & Burling.
Holder said in a statement Wednesday he is “honored” to work with California’s Legislature “as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California’s residents and policy priorities.”",positive

“Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help!” Trump tweeted.
Most of the Chicago statistics were grim, showing the nation’s third-largest city recorded 1,100 more shooting incidents than in 2015 and had homicides spike by 278 – the largest increase in 60 years.
CHICAGO'S BLOODIEST YEAR ENDS WITH 762 HOMICIDES
Trump and Emanuel broached the topic of Chicago’s surging violence during a Dec. 7 sit-down. While Emanuel later told reporters most of the meeting focused on immigration, infrastructure and education, he also acknowledged the two had “talked about public safety.”
A spokesman for Emanuel released a statement Sunday, obtained by The Chicago Tribune, that alluded to the December meeting, but did not directly address Trump’s call for possible federal intervention.
“As the president-elect knows from his conversation with the mayor, we agree the federal government has a strong role to play in public safety by funding summer jobs and prevention programming for at-risk youth, by holding the criminals who break our gun laws accountable for their crimes, by passing meaningful gun laws, and by building on the partnerships our police have with federal law enforcement,” the statement from Adam Collins said. “We are heartened he is taking this issue seriously and look forward to working with the new administration on these important efforts.”
Sunday’s tweet wasn’t the first time Trump has taken a public swipe at Emanuel’s handling of the violence epidemic. During an August interview with Fox News' Bill O’Reilly on “The O’Reilly Factor"", Trump said Chicago's crime problem couldn’t be solved “because they don’t have the right people in charge.”
“When I was in Chicago, I got to meet a couple of very tough police,” Trump said. “I said, ‘How do you stop this? How do you stop this? If you were put in charge to a specific person, do you think you could stop this?’ He said, ‘Mr. Trump I would be able to stop it in one week,’ and I believed him 100 percent.”
On the campaign trail, Trump also backed the use of the controversial stop-and-frisk tactic, saying “Chicago needs” it.
“But they asked me about Chicago and I think stop-and-frisk with good strong, you know, good strong law and order,” Trump said during a September event. “But you have to do something. It can’t continue the way it’s going.”",positive

On the roster: Trump thumps House GOP - Fight on ObamaCare replacement heats up - Trump jacks up GM with tweet - Ford demonstrates towing capacity - Red eye, indeed
TRUMP THUMPS HOUSE GOP
It was probably never a good idea for House Republicans to use a procedural gimmick to change ethics rules. It was definitely foolish to do it as their first order of business in the new Congress.
House Speaker Paul Ryan told them so, but his lieutenants were not interested in optics as they prepared to clamp down on the independent Office of Congressional Ethics.
Two tweets from President-elect Donald Trump, however, were enough. In a sharp turn, lawmakers dropped their gambit today.
Trump was understandably miffed at the ham-fisted move by the new Congress to make disempowering watchdogs the first order of business. Not only is it a distraction from his preferred narratives, it also called attention to vast and unresolved questions about Trump’s own ethical quandaries.
What was surprising, though, was that Trump would take on his own party so directly and so publicly.
As Trump acknowledged in his tweets, critics of the ethics office have a point to make. Instituted by Democrats in the wake of the shameful scandals that helped end the previous GOP House majority, the office gives considerable power to anonymous accusers.
It’s not unreasonable for lawmakers to be uncomfortable with the idea that their reputations and careers might be undone in a secret process. As we saw with Wisconsin’s nameless “John Doe” prosecutions, the possibilities for political mischief are real.
But taking on the office as the first order of business and doing so in a way that smacks of procedural shenanigans was foolish.
Perhaps Ryan encouraged Trump to launch the tweets, and is gratified by the result. More likely, however, Trump saw another news story sweeping in that was unhelpful to him and decided that he would change the course of the storm.
That seems more likely to be the case since House members told Fox News that the measure was being killed even before Trump tweeted. But now, rather than doing so on their own, House members appear to have done it at the demand of the incoming president.
That will make Trump look good but it will cause resentments.
Barack Obama’s presidency suffered because of his inability to engage with Congress directly. Standoffish and uninterested in the backslapping that comes with presidential vote wrangling, Obama was aloof.
Trump seems to be going quite the opposite direction. As he watches the legislative sausage making that will take place for the next 17 days until he is inaugurated, one imagines he will be tempted to engage even more.
But he could end up with the same sense from his party that Obama suffered with among Democrats: It’s all about him.
Style should perhaps not matter so much when it comes to making of laws. But it does. There will be a grace period for Trump, perhaps even more than for most presidents given his unfamiliarity with the process.
But the long-term denizens of official Washington will eventually bite back. And they have ways to frustrate any president’s agenda and cause frustrations and embarrassments as yet unseen.
Presidents build loyalty in their parties by delivering donations and victories to its members. But the first step is deference.
So far, Congress hasn’t mattered to Trump’s sudden, astonishing success. That’s going to change a great deal in the coming days. How he manages this relationship will be key to his success or failure.
FIGHT ON OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT HEATS UP
As Donald Trump pointed out in a couple of tweets today, ObamaCare is not anyone’s favorite federal entitlement program. Congressional Republicans are banking on broad dissatisfaction with the 2010 law as they move to swiftly start dismantling President Obama’s signature initiative.
Certainly the repeal is the fun and easy part. Doing so means not only pleasing the Republican base, but also has other niceties like a massive tax cut. The current plan in Congress calls for eating dessert first: repeal the law now, but work out its replacement over the next few years.
Conservatives like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and liberals like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are crying foul, albeit for different reasons. The concern on the right is that whatever comes next will be too expensive, too intrusive and not focused on free-market solutions. On the left, the concerns are about throwing the $20 million people covered under the law off of their health insurance.
What Republicans are trying to do now is shift the focus away from the question of health insurance and on to health care. If the standard is how many people have coverage, any disruption, no matter how gradual, could turn the change into the liability. If the focus becomes the cost of care as it was prior to ObamaCare, then the GOP has a shot at selling a replacement plan.
Either way, Republicans seem unlikely to be able to agree on a replacement before the promised repeal comes due. The question for both conservatives and liberals: can they effectively threaten to block the repeal until the replacement is laid out.
President Obama heads to the Hill Wednesday, as does Vice President-elect Mike Pence and they’re both expected to talk about ObamaCare with members of their parties.
That’s a good reflection of how dominant this fight is likely to become.
THE RULEBOOK: THE UNSOCIAL NETWORK
“This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.” – John Jay, Federalist No. 2
TIME OUT: THE FIRE AND THE FLOOD
NatGeo: “‘Late in the autumn of 1680 the good people of Manhattan were overcome with terror at a sight in the heavens such as has seldom greeted human eyes,’ history tells us. That terrible sight was a comet so bright that it could be seen in daytime. But…the Great Comet of 1680 was not a portent of doom but a scientific blessing. Sir Isaac Newton observed the comet, and his calculations of its trajectory confirmed his universal theory of gravitation…The comet of 1680 would likewise inspire one of Newton’s closest colleagues and friends: the mathematician William Whiston, whose intricate calculations would bring him fame in Europe. This comet, he declared, had passed close to Earth thousands of years ago…In short, Whiston concluded, the same comet seen by incredulous sky-watchers in the 17th century also unleashed the epic rainfall and great Flood that had cleansed the Earth of sinners in Biblical times.”

TEAM TRUMP PROMISES PRESSER… SOON
President-elect Donald Trump’s team says he will hold his first press conference since July on or about Jan. 11. The original date was Dec. 15, but Trump called it off while his team formulated an approach to untangling Trump from his businesses. After going nearly half a year without a press conference, what are the big issues he’ll have to address?
--Conflicts of interest: Trump made a special New Year’s Eve shout out to his business partner, Emirati billionaire Hussain Sajwani, with whom Trump built one golf course in Dubai and is in the process of building another. The celebratory toast highlights again the complexities of having a developer for a president. Could foreign governments threaten or try to bribe him by doing or cancelling deals with his company even if he is not running it on a day-to-day basis?
--Russia: Also at his New Year’s Eve party, Trump told assembled reporters that he knew “things that other people don’t know” about Russia’s involvement in the presidential election. Trump claimed he would make his information public today or Wednesday, but if he doesn’t this will be a key point, especially as Republican lawmakers intend to have their committees look further into the matter. As WSJ’s Bret Stephens observes, politicizing intelligence has serious consequences. The only claim out so far this week is one from Julian Assange, who published some of the stolen documents. Assange, who formerly hosted a show on Russian state television, told Sean Hannity that Russia was not the source.
--Anxious electorate: A new Gallup survey shows less than half of Americans think Trump is capable of handling his duties, a dramatic decrease from President Obama or George W. Bush when they entered office.
TRUMP JACKS UP GM WITH TWEET
The Detroit News: “President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened General Motors Co. with a ‘big border tax’ on Chevy Cruze cars built in Mexico and imported for sale in the United States. The Republican businessman has proposed a 35 percent import tariff on Mexican-made vehicles and often targeted Ford Motor Co. during his hard-fought campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. He turned his focus on General Motors in a Tuesday morning tweet. ‘General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,’ he wrote. ‘Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!’”
Ford demonstrates towing capacity - Reuters: “Ford Motor Co said Tuesday it will cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and will invest $700 million at a Michigan factory as it expands its electric vehicle and hybrid offerings. The second largest U.S. automaker had come under harsh criticism from President-elect Donald Trump for its Mexican investment plans.”
SUBSTITUTIONS
--Robert Lighthizer, former deputy trade representative under Ronald Reagan, is Trump’s pick for U.S. trade representative.
--Marc Short, a top adviser to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, is set as director of legislative affairs for the Trump White House, reports Politico.

FROM THE BLEACHERS
“Your assertion ‘Kellyanne Conway…the best Trump-to-English translator in the business’ brought a chuckle. Your media colleagues and the political establishment may need a translator, but most of us Trump voters (proud to be Hillary’s ‘deplorables’) understand Donald Trump himself. We have since the early days of the primaries. The voters get it, the elites do not.” – Phil Reberger, Boise, Idaho
[Ed. note: Like any good contractor, Trump knows to put in plenty of exits. The most politically useful thing about Trump’s linguistic somersaults is that meanings change with the moment. We’ve seen the course play out many times. Trump says something dramatic but vague. The media freaks out, shifting the debate to Trump’s topic and, sometimes, his terms. Trump then clarifies and re-clarifies and re-clarifies again until he ends up with a position that he likes and is politically sustainable. Watching him throw a verbal asterisk on what had sounded like an absolute ban on Muslims entering the United States in December 2015 was a perfect example. Trump was talking, reading from his script and then he seemed to realize he would need some more wiggle room in this policy. As if it had just come to him, Trump added the phrase, “…until our countries’ representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.” It’s about to get harder, though. Candidates have one job: win the election. Presidents have thousands of jobs and things can get complicated quickly. As his pronouncements turn in to policies, Trump will be well served by having a communications consigliere as skilled as Conway. She understands the limits of language, but also knows her boss’ style and strategy. The new president’s success or failure could depend a great deal on her ability to translate Trump.]
“I was not a Trump supporter at the beginning but I appreciate how he made it through the primaries. He may not be a policy wonk but he knows how to get things done and hire people who are doers not thinkers. Hillary’s and the Democratic supporters’ self-righteousness, arrogance and self-entitlement was their downfall. Too bad they are not taking the high road that they preach about.” – Brian Repsher, Arlington Heights, Ill.
[Ed. note: One of the minor miracles of Trump’s election has been the sudden embrace of federalism and the division of powers by liberals. It has been odd to see the American left fall in love with Alexander Hamilton over the last two years. The Broadway musical that bears his name is really good, but not so good, I wouldn’t have thought, to make the founding federalist attractive to populist-leaning Democrats. We may have unwittingly been witnessing the acceleration of a shift as the Republicans become a party of the masses and the Democrats become the party of the elites. If that’s the case, then handing off Hamilton was perhaps a natural progression of things. Whatever the case, liberals’ new love for the limitations on government power bear out what Hamilton and his fellows knew: faction is helpful when put to the cause of restraining the Leviathan.]
“Hollywood didn’t support the President-Elect before the election so why ask them to be involved following it. Trump’s movement was by the common man so I suggest all the performers be ‘common people’ - nobody with any big name. There are LOTS of extremely talented folks in the USA who would jump at the chance to be a part of the activities. Start the whole thing off with Copland’s ‘Fanfare for the Common Man.’ There would be no more fitting piece of music.” – Robert Holcomb, San Antonio
[Ed. note: There would be some real resonance to what you suggest, Mr. Holcomb. But a couple of things to bear in mind: adding the responsibilities of talent scout to the already over-burdened Trump transition team seems like a bit of excess, and inaugurations are moments to celebrate and fit for fanfare. Perhaps a better solution would be to simply return to the days when marching bands provided the entertainment, save a special rendition of a patriotic anthem by a great singer for the ceremony, and cut out the star search. The newly inaugurated president needs a band for the inaugural ball he hosts, but the rest of the festivities can be handled by the individual states and organizations that put them on. Let 2017 be John Philip Souza’s revenge!]

413,"President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he would hold a ""general news conference"" on Jan. 11, his first formal press conference since his November election victory.
Trump had been scheduled to hold a press conference on Dec. 15 to discuss his plan to leave his sprawling business empire as he takes office Jan. 20, but that event was postponed.
Since taking office, Trump has sat for a few television interviews and has taken a handful of shouted questions from the press pool — a small group of reporters who follow the president — both at Trump Tower in New York and outside his coastal Florida estate.
Trump's last full-fledged news conference was July 27, which he held at his Miami-area golf course as counterprogramming to the ongoing Democratic National Convention. It was there that Trump called upon Russia to hack his opponent Hillary Clinton's emails saying, ""I will tell you this, Russia: If you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.""
His staff later insisted that Trump was joking.
In lieu of press conferences, the president-elect has communicated to the American public through tweets, as well as a series of December ""Thank You"" rallies in states that helped provide his winning margin in the Electoral College.
Trump's team has downplayed the need for news conferences. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, said last month that the press would have access to the president.
""This will be a traditional White House in the sense that you will have a great deal of press availability on a daily basis and you'll have a president who continues to be engaged with the press,"" she said in an interview with ABC.
While Trump's lack of press interaction is a worry to some, many of his supporters cheered the celebrity businessman's battles with what they felt were biased reporters. Trump made his antagonistic relationship with the media a centerpiece of his campaign, inciting his rally crowds to boo the press, singling out individual reporters with derogatory names like ""sleazebag"" and using Twitter to attack coverage he didn't like.
His predecessors took a different approach.
Two days after the Supreme Court decision gave him the 2000 election, George W. Bush held a press conference where reporters asked him about his Cabinet picks and tax plans. He proceeded to field more questions each of the next two days. Barack Obama, also regularly held news conferences after winning, taking questions from the White House press corps 18 different times as president-elect. Bush, who had a shorter transition due to the extended Florida recount, did so 11 times.

415,"The Obama administration flatly rejected a warning from President-elect Trump to stop transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay, telling reporters on Tuesday that more inmates will be moved from the military prison before the current president leaves office.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest told members of the press corps to ""expect ... additional transfers"" before the end of President Obama's second term, noting that the current administration has long sought to close the controversial detention center in Cuba where 59 prisoners remain.
The announcement came hours after Obama's Republican successor tweeted his disapproval of numerous transfers that have already occurred and warned against resettling additional detainees outside of the United States.
""There should be no further releases from Gitmo,"" Trump said. ""These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.""

Ford Motor Company announced Tuesday it will cancel a $1.6 billion plant planned for Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in a Michigan assembly plant, directly tying the decision to “pro-growth policies” championed by President-elect Donald Trump.

Trump had previously been critical of Ford’s plans to build in Mexico. After the announcement, Trump tweeted a link to a story about the Ford decision and then added in a subsequent message: ""Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.""
“We’re doing this decision based on what’s right for our business,” Ford CEO Mark Fields told Neil Cavuto on Fox Business Network. “As we think about the investments here in Michigan, as you can imagine, Neil, we look at a lot of factors as we make those. One of the factors that we’re looking at is a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and some of the pro-growth policies he said he’s going to pursue. And so this is a vote of confidence.”

Fields said Ford would have gone ahead with the decision whether or not Trump was elected president, however, he did say that he alerted both Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence ahead of the announcement on Tuesday.
The Ford news was the latest in a string of pre-inauguration successes for Trump in the manufacturing sector.
In early December, air conditioner and furnace maker Carrier agreed to stay in Indiana after weeks of negotiations headed by Pence. The decision reportedly saved about 700 jobs that would have been shifted to Mexico.
Later in the month, wireless provider Sprint and Internet company OneWeb announced they would be adding thousands of jobs in the U.S. Both companies are controlled by SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, who had previously met with Trump.
Earlier Tuesday morning, Trump took aim at another auto giant: General Motors.
""General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!"" Trump tweeted.
GM, however, quickly pushed back on Trump's assertions.
""GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S."" a statement said.
The investment in the Flat Rock Assembly Plant is set to create 700 jobs, according to Fields. The money, which was taken from the $1.6 billion earmarked for the Mexico plant, will be used to open a new factory that will build high-tech autonomous and electric vehicles as well as the Mustang and Lincoln Continental, the company said in a press release.
""I am thrilled that we have been able to secure additional UAW-Ford jobs for American workers,"" UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles said in the release.

418,"House Democrats joined Big Labor on Tuesday in voicing support for Donald Trump's push to renegotiate NAFTA and other trade deals -- while also vowing to hold the incoming Republican president to that campaign promise.
“Trump said he wants to fight for trade deals that put American workers first, and so do we,” said Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio. “We are going to give very strong support for rewriting NAFTA. The momentum for a new direction is very, very clear and growing.”
The Oregon congressman was joined by several other House Democrats and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka in arguing that decades of unfair trade deals have eliminated millions of U.S. jobs.
The press conference on Capitol Hill, held at the start of the 115th Congress, offered a glimpse at an area where Trump and Democrats could find common ground.
Trump won the presidency in large part by appealing to disaffected Americans, including many across the Midwest who have lost good-paying manufacturing jobs and have been marginalized in the workforce. The Republican threatened to scrap NAFTA if Canada and Mexico do not come to the negotiating table.
Trumka -- leader of the country’s largest trade union group -- said Tuesday he told Trump after his upset victory in November that he’d be willing to work with him.
“Entire communities have lost their purpose and identity. And we have to fix that,” said Trumka, whose union backed failed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. “Working people are looking for a new way forward on trade ... and we have to begin today.”
Trumka outlined what he called several “broad” changes to NAFTA that include tougher trade enforcement and reworking labor agreements but later acknowledged, “Frankly, every chapter should be improved.”
At the same time, the House Democrats rolled out their 21 Century Bill of Rights, which they called “key principles” for rewriting a host of international trade deals including NAFTA, which Clinton’s husband, President Bill Clinton, signed into law in the early-1990s.
Trumka and House Democrats also boasted that they have essentially defeated the Obama administration-driven Trans Pacific Partnership pact and called for Trump to put an official end to the deal, along with reworking NAFTA with Canada and Mexico in his first 100 days in office.
“TPP is dead,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, of Connecticut.
However, she and others expressed concerns about working with Trump and about what he might do as president -- including whether he could get the GOP-controlled Congress and the so-called “free traders” among his Cabinet picks to go along with trade reform. And they raised concerns about whether his reworked deals would further protect U.S. workers and the environment.
“If he makes the workers’ lives or the environment worse, he will have a serious price to pay,” said DeLauro, who joined her fellow Democrats in calls to hold Trump “accountable.”",positive
419,"Senate Democrats reportedly plan to attack eight of Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks and stretch their confirmation process from days to perhaps months, despite having essentially no chance of blocking their nominations.
The Democratic senators are vowing to make good on their vow unless the nominees start disclosing personal financial information, according to The Washington Post.
Trump has made eight of 17 Cabinet picks, with four remaining.
The primary targets include Rex Tillerson for secretary of state; Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general; South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney for the Office of Management and Budget; Betsy DeVos as the new education secretary and Steve Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs executive nominated to be treasury secretary.
“President-elect Trump is attempting to fill his rigged Cabinet with nominees that … have made billions off the industries they’d been tasked with regulating,” incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. “If Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they’re sorely mistaken.”
Republicans who control the Senate and House plan to begin the confirmation hearings on Trump’s Jan. 20 Inauguration Day.
Republicans have a 52-to-48 majority over Democrats in the Senate.
The nominees will get enough votes in the GOP-run Senate committees but would run into delays when both parties cast final votes on the chamber floor, despite needing only 51 “yeahs.”
Democrats could use procedural moves to extend the debate on each of the nominees. But they don’t have the power to use the filibuster to block the nominations, because in the last Congress they changed the threshold on such filibusters from 60 to 51 votes.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and fellow Republicans don’t like the Democrats’ plan and argue they didn’t oppose outgoing Democratic President Obama’s nominations when he took office in 2008.
“Republicans and Democrats worked together and expeditiously to carefully consider his nominees,” McConnell spokesman David Popp told Fox News on Monday.
Popp points out that the Senate held hearings on multiple nominees before Obama was even sworn in, confirmed seven of them on Day One and that nearly all of them were confirmed within two weeks.
“Sen. Schumer and others approved wholeheartedly of this approach at the time,” Popp continued. “So surely they won’t object to treating the incoming president’s nominees with the same courtesy and seriousness.”
The others on the purported list of eight are Georgia GOP Rep. Tom Price, Trump’s nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services; Andrew Puzder for labor secretary; and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to run the EPA.
Those not on the purported list are Marine Gen. James N. Mattis for defense secretary; South Carolina GOP Gov. Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; and former Marine Gen. John Kelly run the Department of Homeland Security.

“You see this flurry of activity by a tough President Obama as he exits the office,” Conway said. “You can’t put daylight between the US and Israel.”
“We do wonder about the rush to do all these things the next couple of weeks by the Obama administration,” Conway added.
“January 20th will be here quickly and it’s very important to all of us,” Conway said of the Trump administration taking office. “I think it’s important to America that you see that peaceful transition of power from administration to administration. “",positive
422,"Inquiries from Donald Trump’s transition team to federal agencies about their work on hot-button issues like climate change and 'violent extremism' -- and about the staffers involved -- have spurred questions over what the incoming administration has planned for those programs.
His team, in the roughly seven weeks since the election, has posed such questions to the departments of Energy, State and Homeland Security.
Critics of President-elect Trump have suggested the inquiries are a sign his administration intends to gut key programs and punish the staffers involved. Republican defenders, though, say these concerns are overblown.
“The Democrats are trying to talk about anything other than their own problems, and currently they include stoking faux outrage about President-elect Trump rolling back women's rights and firing bureaucrats who don't agree with his environmental policy,” Republican strategist Joe Desilets said Wednesday.
The inquiries began earlier this month when transition team members submitted 74 questions to the Energy Department regarding climate change and other policy issues, including two about staffers who worked on President Obama’s climate agenda.
Energy officials have pledged to cooperate with the incoming Republican administration but didn’t provide the staffers’ names. The transition team hastily struck the questions, but not before a storm of criticism.
Max Stier, founding president of the Partnership for Public Service, which started the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition, told FoxNews.com that both sides handled the matter “appropriately” but that the personnel questions were “unusual and unsettling.”
“Career employees are responsible for executing the policy directives the president sets,” Stier told FoxNews.com. “You don’t hold people accountable for the policies set by people elected by the American public. That’s just wrong.”
The transition team did not respond for a request for comment.
The Los Angeles Times also reported that the team has inquired with the State Department about gender-based programs, asking about “staffing, programming and funding,” including those started or championed by Hillary Clinton when she ran the department.
Stier said the inquiries from Trump’s landing team at the State Department about spending and other matters such as this are not unusual.
“Questions about the policy landscape are entirely legitimate,” he said. “It’s a different kettle of fish.”
Aside from recent tensions regarding the Obama administration’s latest confrontation with Israel, Trump and Obama largely have maintained a cordial relationship since the election. The two met at the White House in November. And the president has pledged cooperation to help ensure a smooth transition for the incoming administration, ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.
However, Energy spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder recently said some of the transition team questions left agency staffers “unsettled.”
Climate change – which holds that the earth’s gradual warming is a result of human activity including the burning of fossil fuel -- has been called a “hoax” by Trump.
Though his transition team withdrew the personnel questions to the Energy Department, two influential House Democrats still submitted their objections.
“We are concerned that these efforts to single out particular department employees involved in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may be an attempt to target DOE employees whose scientific views on climate change differ from those of the incoming Trump administration,” wrote Reps. Elijah Cumming, of Maryland, and Frank Pallone, of New Jersey, the top Democrats, respectively, on the House’s Oversight and Energy committees.
State Department spokesman John Kirby later characterized the requests to his department as “normal” questions about how an agency “is staffed, it is manned and it is resourced.”
“Nothing that I’ve seen and nothing that we’re aware of falls outside the lines of what would be a normal,” he said.
Reuters, meanwhile, reported that the team also has asked the State and Homeland Security department for the names of officials working on efforts to counter “violent extremism.”
Reuters reported that some career officials were concerned about what the incoming administration would do regarding those programs.
During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to fight radical Islamic terrorism and frequently criticized Obama for avoiding the term “radical Islam” to describe the Islamic State and other such terror groups.

423,"A New York school board demanded Thursday that the co-chairman of President-elect Donald Trump’s New York campaign resign from its board, after he said he would like to see the president die of Mad Cow Disease.
Carl Paladino, an ally of Trump and a millionaire developer, told a local publication that he would like to see President Obama die of the disease, and see First Lady Michelle Obama living with a gorilla in Africa.
“Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Hereford. He dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to Valerie Jarrett, who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a jihadi cellmate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her,” he said, according to the New York Post.
Paladino later apologized, saying the comments weren’t meant for publication.
“I wanted to say something as sarcastic and hurtful as possible about the people (the Obamas) so responsible for the hurt and suffering of so many others,” he said, according to the Post. “I was wired up, primed to be human and make a mistake. I could have not made a worse choice in the words I used to express my feelings.”
The apology has not been accepted by the school board in Buffalo. It voted 6-2 Thursday to ask the state education commissioner to remove Paladino if he does not resign from office. The two who did not back the motion called on Paladino to apologize to every student. Paladino was not in attendance but has said that he will not resign.
A crowd applauded when the vote was taken, and shouted down Paladino’s allies.
“Words matter, Mr. Paladino. This community has been rocked,” said board president Barbara Seals Nevergold.

425,"President-elect Donald Trump blasted President Obama on Wednesday over his administration’s treatment of Israel, accusing him of making “inflammatory” statements and putting up “roadblocks” that are hampering the transition.
The incoming president took to Twitter to assure Israel that his administration will bring a new approach, in advance of a speech on the Middle East peace process by Secretary of State John Kerry. The already-turbulent relationship between the Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu governments has lurched into its rockiest stretch yet in the final days of the Obama administration, after the U.S. abstained on an anti-settlement resolution before the U.N. Security Council, allowing it to pass.
Trump tweeted: “We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect.”
And in a swipe at the outgoing president after a period of relative peace between the two, he wrote, “Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!”
The Israeli government has turned to President-elect Trump’s team for support in recent days, openly saying they look forward to working with the next president amid fraying ties with the outgoing administration.
Netanyahu has described the U.S. abstention that allowed the U.N. resolution to pass as an “ambush,” and his government has gone on to accuse the U.S. of playing a hand in orchestrating the vote.
In the hours before Kerry’s speech, the Netanyahu government took another shot at the U.S., with Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan calling Kerry’s speech a “pathetic step.”
He told Israel Army Radio that “Kerry's intention is to chain President-elect Trump.""
The White House has pushed back on claims that the Obama administration helped craft and push the resolution – and on Wednesday morning, denied another report in Egyptian media claiming Kerry and National Security Adviser Susan Rice discussed the U.N. resolution with a top Palestinian official nearly two weeks before Friday’s Security Council vote.
Ned Price, spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, called the reports a “fabrication” and said the “meeting never occurred.”
The State Department’s own website reflects that Kerry was scheduled for a meeting with the Palestinian official at the State Department on Dec. 12, around the time of the reported discussions. The official website, however, offers no details on what was discussed.

426,"President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday the addition of roughly 8,000 new jobs for Americans, including 5,000 that telecommunications giant Sprint will bring from “all around the world.”
“They’re coming back to the United States, which is a nice change,” he said.
Trump, who takes office January 20, said the other 3,000 jobs will be hires from a new company called One Web.
Trump was elected in part on the promise to return to the United States jobs that American companies had moved overseas, in search of cheaper labor costs.
Last month, he announced that Carrier would keep roughly 1,000 jobs in Indiana, after months of criticizing the air-conditioning corporation on the campaign trail for plans to move the jobs to Mexico.
Trump spoke Wednesday from his Mar a Largo estate in Palm Beach, Florida.
The wealthy businessman-turned politician also said he had a “nice” and “general” conversation earlier in the day with outgoing President Obama.
Trump opposed the Obama administration’s move last week to allow the United Nations to pass a resolution condemning Israel for building more settlements in the disputed West Bank.
He said Secretary of State John Kerry’s speech earlier Wednesday defending the administration’s U.N. decision “spoke for itself.”
Trump, who in recent days has been especially critical of the U.N., also said that the international body “has tremendous potential but is not living up to itself.”
Trump added he had help on the jobs deals from several people including Massayoshi Son, the chief executive officer for SoftBank of Japan, which owns Sprint.

427,"President-elect Donald Trump appointed an experienced hand from the George W. Bush era to his national security circle Tuesday and a figure from the Trump Organization to make international deals.
Thomas Bossert will become as assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. A statement from Trump's transition team said Bossert will advise the president on issues related to homeland security, counterterrorism, and cybersecurity, and coordinate the Cabinet's process for making and executing policy in those areas.
The position notably ""is being elevated and restored to its independent status alongside the national security adviser,"" the statement said. Policymakers have long debated whether such national security jobs should operate independently from the White House.
Bossert will work closely with Trump's pick for national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. Bossert is currently president of the risk management consulting firm CDS Consulting. He previously served as deputy assistant to the president for homeland security under Bush.
The president-elect also appointed one of his main advisers on U.S.-Israel relations as special representative for international negotiations. Jason Greenblatt has worked for the Trump Organization for over two decades and currently serves as its executive vice president and chief legal officer.
In the statement, Trump said Greenblatt ""has a history of negotiating substantial, complex transactions on my behalf,"" and has the expertise to ""bring parties together and build consensus on difficult and sensitive topics.""
Trump's West Wing is shaping up to have multiple power centers. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Steve Bannon will work as ""equal partners,"" according to Trump, and counselor Kellyanne Conway is also expected to have autonomy. Trump's influential son-in-law, Jared Kushner, will also have a direct line to the president.
Trump has long stoked rivalries among his staff in business and in the campaign. But doing so in the White House could sow confusion and slow decision-making.
Trump recently named his other top adviser on Israel, David Friedman, as his pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel.
The president-elect is spending the holidays in his Florida resort where he's held a steady stream of meetings with senior staffers, advisers and business executives. A number of key posts in his government remain, his transition team saying that he will fill those positions in the coming days.
Meanwhile, Trump's efforts to dissolve his charitable foundation before he takes office to eliminate any conflicts of interest appear to be harder than he thought.
The New York attorney general's office said Tuesday that Trump cannot move ahead with his plan to dismantle his charitable foundation because state prosecutors are probing whether the president-elect personally benefited from its spending.
""The Trump foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,"" said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.
The statement came after Trump announced that he wanted to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, part of what his presidential transition team says is an effort to erase any potential conflicts of interest before he takes office Jan. 20.
But the foundation's inner workings have been the subject of Schneiderman's investigation for months and could remain a thorny issue for Trump's incoming administration. Democrats nationally have said they are ready to raise any legal or ethical issues from Trump's global business empire during his presidency.
Trump's charity has admitted that it violated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.
The admissions by the Donald J. Trump Foundation were in a 2015 tax filing made public after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump has used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000 political contribution and purchase items, such as a painting of himself, that was displayed at one of his properties.
In the tax filing, posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar on Nov. 18, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But the tax filing doesn't provide details on the violations.
Trump asserted on Twitter late Monday that his foundation was run efficiently.

It was the latest of several tweets from Trump, who is spending the holiday week at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.
Earlier Monday, Trump questioned the effectiveness of the United Nations, saying it's just a club for people to ""have a good time,"" after the U.N. Security Council voted last week to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem,
And on Friday, Trump warned, ""As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,"" referring to the day he takes office.
The decision by the Obama administration to abstain from Friday's U.N. vote brushed aside Trump's demands that the U.S. exercise its veto and provided a climax to years of icy relations with Israel's leadership.
That was only one subject Trump tackled on Twitter on Monday. In an evening post, he wrote that he believes his election as president has boosted the economy.
""The world was gloomy before I won -- there was no hope,"" he tweeted. ""Now, the market is up nearly 10 percent and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars.""
Markets are up since Trump won the general election, although not by that much. The Standard & Poor's 500 is up about 6 percent since Election Day, while the Dow has risen more than 8 percent.
As for holiday spending, auditing and accounting firm Deloitte projected in September that total 2016 holiday sales were expected to exceed $1 trillion, representing a 3.6 percent to 4.0 percent increase in holiday sales from November through January. But that can't be credited to Trump because the projection came before the election.",positive
429,"President-elect Donald Trump’s preemptive strike on the price tag of two major projects with leading defense contractors has fiscal hawks hopeful the incoming administration can rein in Pentagon contract costs even as Trump vows to invest in rebuilding the U.S. military.
“I hope this will be an opportunity to look at the Pentagon more clearly from someone who has not been part of the system,” Mandy Smithberger, director of military reform for the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), told FoxNews.com.
Since early December, Trump has been browbeating Boeing and Lockheed Martin over the costs of the next Air Force One and the F-35, respectively.
“I don't need a $4.2 billion airplane to fly around in,” Trump told “Fox News Sunday” earlier this month, referring to Air Force One.
His criticism led to meetings last week with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson.
Muilenburg afterward committed to deliver the next Air Force One for far less than $4 billion. Trump then turned up the heat on Lockheed, tweeting, “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!”
TRUMP ASKS BOEING TO 'PRICE-OUT' ALTERNATIVE TO LOCKHEED'S F-35
Hewson put out a statement Friday, after another conversation with Trump, saying she heard his message “loud and clear.”
“I gave him my personal commitment to drive the cost down aggressively,” she said. “I know that President-elect Trump wants the very best capability for our military at the lowest cost for taxpayers and we’re ready to deliver!”
The cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has grown to $400 billion for 2,457 planes to be used by the U.S. and its allies, about twice the initial estimate. Boeing, for its part, was awarded the Air Force One contract in January 2015. The Air Force budget in research and development for the contract is reportedly $2.9 billion through fiscal 2021, while procurement is $1 billion.
Trump’s early intervention on these two projects, taking a nearly unprecedented level of interest in contract negotiations for a president-elect, has buoyed groups that for years have tried to control costs for what President Dwight Eisenhower first dubbed the “military industrial complex.”
Trump also wants “lifetime bans” for Pentagon acquisition officials from ever going to work for defense contractors.
But watchdogs say, going forward, Trump will have to take more far-reaching actions to keep costs in line.
Smithberger said reforms should include modernization, greater transparency, and comprehensive testing, which POGO calls a “fly before you buy” policy.
“That would absolutely be a key first step if he wants to drain the swamp,” Smithberger said. “The Pentagon is not the only problem. Congress aids and abets by using the Pentagon as a jobs program.”
As he signals changes for defense contracts, Trump also has vowed to grow the military itself. In a September speech, Trump said he will ask Congress to eliminate the budget-tightening measure known as the defense “sequester” while pursuing a force build-up in the Army and Marine Corps, an increase in ships and submarines for the Navy, and an increase in fighter aircraft for the Air Force. How he balances those goals with his push to cut costs remains to be seen.
Key to any Pentagon reforms will be Trump’s choice for Defense secretary, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis. The general, however, has been on the board of directors for defense contractor General Dynamics since 2013.
“It raises some concerns about his ability to reform the system,” Smithberger said of Mattis.
Still, the retired general’s experience as head of U.S. Central Command and as a NATO commander might provide a useful perspective for reform, said Ben Fitzgerald, director technology and national security at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based national security think tank.
“Trump could be more focused and demand results and accountability” from the Pentagon, Fitzgerald told FoxNews.com. “General Mattis is not a contract guy, but he understands the importance of having the right equipment in the hands of our war fighters.”
Boeing and Lockheed both have stressed they want to deliver value for the U.S. government.
“Boeing is committed to providing the best value for warfighters and taxpayers,” company spokesman Todd Belcher told FoxNews.com in a statement. “That’s a goal we share with our partners in the Department of Defense. We work closely with them every day to ensure that we are making strong progress on meeting that goal.”
The two firms on the receiving end of Trump’s critiques, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, also are in a partnership for the United Launch Alliance, which manufactures rockets. This year, the joint venture got an $860 million contract for maintenance and sustainment.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich backed Trump’s tougher tone on contractors, predicting he’ll act more like a governor than a traditional president in his level of involvement. He told “Fox News Sunday” the Pentagon’s acquisition process needs to be “totally redone.”
“Serving notice that we are not trapped by large contractors with big armies of lobbyists is going to shake up Washington as much as any single thing you can do,” Gingrich said on “Fox News Sunday.”
The record of skyrocketing costs and less-than-ideal transparency is ample, pointing to the magnitude of the task ahead.
The Defense Department hasn’t issued a single statement of budgetary resources since the enactment of the 1990 Chief Financial Officers Act, which required such statements from agencies, according to POGO.
In February, the Defense Department inspector general concluded the Air Force didn’t properly negotiate maintenance contracts at the Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, and improperly paid between $9.6 million and $24.9 million in questionable fees to Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Honeywell. In a 2014 report, the Government Accountability Office determined the cost of growth for the Pentagon’s weapon programs in 2013 grew by $448 billion with an average delay of two years for completion of projects.
The Defense Department risks losing its technological advantage over other countries, according to a new report by the Center for a New American Security. The report says the military must create a more market-oriented competitive system. Further, the report states this wouldn’t have to increase costs if done effectively.
“Under such a strategy, the DoD could leverage the almost $2 trillion of global commercial research and development more effectively, mitigate the risks of overruns and program cancellations (estimated from $58 to $116 billion between 1997 and 2015, not including classified programs), and better manage its operational and maintenance costs,” the report says. “Above all, this strategy will help the DoD avoid the incalculable costs of losing the nation’s military-technical advantage.”",positive
430,"Democrats are hounding President-elect Donald Trump over his decision to dissolve his charitable foundation, blasting the group as a “slush fund” and demanding he take additional steps to avoid conflicts of interest.
The incoming president announced Saturday that he’s directed his counsel to complete the closure.
Trump said in a statement: “I am very proud of the money that has been raised for many organizations in need, and I am also very proud of the fact that the Foundation has operated at essentially no cost for decades, with 100% of the money going to charity, but because I will be devoting so much time and energy to the Presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world, I don’t want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest.”
But the Democratic National Committee signaled the decision wasn’t good enough for them.
Deputy Communications Director Eric Walker, in a statement, called the announcement a “wilted fig leaf to cover up his remaining conflicts of interest and his pitiful record of charitable giving.”
During the presidential campaign, Democrats sought to draw attention to controversies surrounding Trump’s foundation as Republicans hammered Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her family’s foundation – and its alleged conflicts while she was secretary of state.
Walker renewed those allegations in the wake of Trump’s announcement, saying his charity “has a pitiful record of service, and instead has served as a slush fund for Trump to bribe elected officials, attack his political enemies and buy portraits of himself.”
The statement also took a jab at the president-elect over his controversial business holdings: ""Shuttering a charity is no substitute for divesting from his for-profit business and putting the assets in a blind trust -- the only way to guarantee separation between the Trump administration and the Trump business.""
Walker further questioned how the shut-down would “accommodate the investigation into the foundation.”
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been investigating the foundation following media reports that foundation spending went to benefit Trump's campaign. A spokeswoman says the foundation cannot close until the investigation is complete.
Documents obtained by The Associated Press in September showed Schneiderman's scrutiny of The Donald J. Trump Foundation dated back to at least June, when his office formally questioned the donation made by the charity to a group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Bondi personally solicited the money during a 2013 phone call that came after her office received complaints from former students claiming they were scammed by Trump University.
The Trump Foundation check arrived just days after Bondi's office told a newspaper it was reviewing a lawsuit against Trump University filed by Schneiderman. Bondi's office never sued Trump, though she denies his donation played any role in that decision.
Trump later paid a $2,500 fine over the check from his foundation because it violated federal law barring charities from making political contributions.
A 2015 tax return posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar shows the Donald J. Trump Foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of IRS regulations -- not only during 2015, but in prior years.
Those regulations prohibit self-dealing by the charity. That's broadly defined as using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.
The tax filing doesn't provide details on the violations. Whether Trump benefited from the foundation's spending has been the subject of the Schneiderman probe.
In his statement on Saturday, Trump said his foundation has “done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children. However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.”
Trump's announcement came a day after the president-elect took to Twitter to declare it a ""ridiculous shame"" that his son Eric will have to stop soliciting funds for his charitable foundation, the Eric Trump Foundation, because of a conflict of interest.
""My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with my presidency,"" Trump tweeted. ""He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!""
Trump was highly critical during the campaign of the Clinton Foundation. At the final presidential debate, he challenged Clinton to ""give back the money"" that came from donors in countries that fail to respect various human rights.
More than half the people outside the government who met with Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money -- either personally or through companies or groups -- to the Clinton Foundation. The proportion indicated possible ethics challenges had she been elected president.

431,"President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he will dissolve his philanthropic foundation to avoid “even the appearance” of a conflict of interest, as he prepares to take over the White House next month.
The plan to shutter the Donald J. Trump Foundation was not unexpected, amid continuing criticism that Trump’s international real estate holdings and other business ventures will present for him as president potential conflicts of interest.
“The foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children,” Trump said in a statement released by his presidential transition office. “However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as president, I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.”
The statement also said that Trump has asked his legal team to start dissolving the foundation, which he said operated for decades at essentially no cost and funneled 100 percent of the money to charity.
“But because I will be devoting so much time and energy to the presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world, I don’t want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest,"" he said.
The foundation is already under investigation by the New York attorney general in connection with fundraising efforts.
Who will run the Trump Organization while Trump is in the White House also remains unclear, since daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner now appear headed to work in the administration.
Trump’s announcement Saturday follows son Eric Trump saying last week that he would stop fundraising for his self-named foundation.

432,"With less than a month until the inauguration, Donald Trump is not waiting to exert his influence on everything from government contract negotiations to international affairs – taking a historically active role for a president-elect while the incumbent is still in office.
Trump’s involvement in seeking changes early to U.S. policy could be seen in the dramatic and rapid-fire developments at the United Nations this week regarding a controversial resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Reuters reported the Israeli government asked Trump to apply pressure on the Obama administration and the United Nations to prevent a Security Council vote after failing to persuade the administration to veto. Trump put out a statement Thursday condemning the resolution and later reportedly spoke to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi – who abruptly postponed the vote on the measure, which his country had proposed.
Nevertheless, the Security Council resumed deliberations and passed the measure on Friday, with the help of an abstention from the U.S. Republicans blasted the U.S. stance as ""shameful,"" while Trump tweeted: ""As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.""
It wasn't the outcome Trump hoped for at the U.N. But his attempt to help the Israelis came after he ventured into difficult diplomatic territory elsewhere. He had a protocol-defying phone call with Taiwan’s president, while later blasting China for seizing a U.S. underwater drone, which China later returned. The Obama administration was actively involved in dealing with China over the drone, but Trump’s commentary made him more than a sideline player.
The president-elect, meanwhile, already is trying to apply the “art of the deal” to government contract talks. He hosted the top executives from Boeing and Lockheed Martin for a meeting at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida this week after blasting the cost of two major projects under their direction – the new Air Force One, and the F-35, respectively.
THE WEEK IN PICTURES
Trump tweeted Thursday that based on the “tremendous” cost overruns of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program, he had even asked the aerospace giant's competitor, Boeing, to ""price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet.""
According to The Washington Post, Trump’s actions and stances have riled the Obama White House.
But Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee spokesman tapped to be the next White House press secretary, said Friday on ""Fox & Friends"" that Trump is “getting things done already and he’s not president yet.”
Asked if Trump should be checking with President Obama before making major statements – such as a recent call to strengthen U.S. nuclear capabilities – Spicer said: “No. He’s the president-elect. He doesn’t need to check.”
Spicer added, “We respect the fact that there’s one president at a time. But this president’s not going to sit back and just wait for things to happen.”
The message, he said, is “business as usual is over.”
While the Cabinet-stacking and other transition efforts being undertaken by Trump’s team are standard for a president-elect in the weeks before inauguration, his hands-on involvement in other areas appears to mark a departure. As during the campaign, Trump often is seeking to move the needle through his preferred mode of communication and negotiation, Twitter.
He tweeted Thursday that the United States should ""greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability"" until the rest of the world ""comes to its senses"" regarding nuclear weapons.
His comments came hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin said strengthening his country's nuclear capabilities should be a chief military objective in the coming year. Trump did not expand on the actions he wants the U.S. to take or say why he raised the issue Thursday.
On Friday, Spicer explained that Trump was putting other countries on notice.
""It was in response to a lot of countries. Russia, China and others are talking about expanding their nuclear capability,"" Spicer said on Fox News.
Spokesman Jason Miller said Thursday the president-elect had been referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation ""particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes.""
Some, though, have raised concerns about the impact any antagonism-by-tweet could have.
John Tierney, a former Democratic congressman and current director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said in a statement it is “dangerous for the President-elect to use just 140 characters and announce a major change in U.S. nuclear weapons policy,” according to the Post.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., put it bluntly on Twitter:
Dear Donald Trump. You're new to this so here's a list of things to tweet about instead of nuclear weapons.

President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday that Spicer will get the coveted job of White House press secretary, as he announced the senior members of his communications team.
This also includes: Hope Hicks as director of strategic communications; Jason Miller as director of communications; and Dan Scavino as director of social media.
“Sean, Hope, Jason and Dan have been key members of my team during the campaign and transition. I am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will Make America Great Again,” Trump said in a statement.
Spicer was thought to have the inside track for the job, in part because of his ties to incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who currently runs the Republican National Committee.
Spicer worked alongside Priebus throughout the 2016 campaign as chief strategist and communications director at the RNC.
After the news was announced, Spicer thanked the incoming president for the “amazing honor.”

437,"(CNN) President Donald Trump announced Monday that Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster will serve as his next national security adviser, filling the void left last week by the sudden dismissal of Michael Flynn.
McMaster, the head of the Army Capabilities Integration Center, will become one of Trump's top national security and foreign policy advisers, taking the helm of the White House's National Security Council, which was left rudderless after Flynn was forced to resign after just 24 days on the job.
Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who had been serving as the acting national security adviser since Flynn's exit, will return to his role as chief of staff of the National Security Council.
Trump announced his decision Monday seated alongside McMaster and Kellogg at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, where a day earlier he interviewed McMaster and several other candidates for the national security adviser post.
""He is a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience,"" Trump said of McMaster. ""I watched and read a lot over the last two days. He is highly respected by everybody in the military, and we're very honored to have him.""
McMaster called the appointment a privilege and said he looks forward to doing ""everything I can to advance and protect the interests of the American people.""
Not first choice
McMaster was not Trump's first choice to assume the role of national security adviser. Trump initially offered the position last week to retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward, who turned it down amid concerns about how the White House was being run, sources told CNN last week.
JUST WATCHED Trump's pick to replace Flynn declines offer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump's pick to replace Flynn declines offer 02:29
The search for a new national security adviser was sparked by a report that revealed Flynn had discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak, before the Trump administration came into office and did not disclose that detail of the conversation to Vice President Mike Pence. Trump said he fired Flynn because of his failure to disclose those details to Pence, but not because of the conversation itself with the Russian ambassador.
McMaster will take on the role after having served several tours of duty in Germany, Southwest Asia and Iraq, including a stint as special assistant to Gen. David Petraeus when he was commander of the US-led coalition forces in Iraq during the 2007 troop surge.
McMaster has a PhD in military history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was tapped for national security adviser over several other finalists for the position, including John Bolton, the hawkish ambassador to the United Nations under George W. Bush who also served in senior positions in the administrations of George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.
Trump signaled Monday that Bolton would soon get a role in his administration ""in a somewhat different capacity"" despite having been passed over for the national security adviser spot. The President noted that Bolton has ""a good number of ideas that, I must tell you, I agree with.""
'Outstanding'
Trump's pick earned quick praise from a contingent of Republican foreign policy leaders in Congress.
California Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, called McMaster ""a fine addition"" to Trump's national security team and pointed in particular to McMaster's ""history of questioning the status quo and infusing fresh thinking and new approaches into military affairs.""
Sen. John McCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman who has been among Trump's chief Republican critics on Capitol Hill, called McMaster ""an outstanding choice.""
""I have had the honor of knowing him for many years, and he is a man of genuine intellect, character, and ability,"" the Arizona senator said in a statement. ""He knows how to succeed. I give President Trump great credit for this decision, as well as his national security cabinet choices. I could not imagine a better, more capable national security team than the one we have right now.""",neutral

New order expected to not impact green card holders
Washington (CNN) The Trump administration is planning to roll out as early as this week a revised executive order on immigration that the President says will ""protect our people"" while at the same time pass muster with courts that halted an earlier version.
Sources said the new order will clarify a point that caused confusion the first time around: The executive order will not impact green card holders.
""The President is contemplating releasing a tighter, more streamlined version of the first executive order,"" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend. Acknowledging the rushed rollout of the previous order that caused chaos in airports across the country and widespread demonstrations, Kelly said that officials are working on a ""phase in"" period for parts of the order to take effect.

The new order is also expected to address concerns of the 9th Circuit federal appeals court, which blocked the original order, that travelers' due process rights were not being respected by giving detailed notice of restrictions for those with current or pending visas. Kelly said the goal was ""to make sure that there's no one, in a sense, caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports, which happened on the first release"" of the order.
Trump's original order, issued a week into his presidency, barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely.

439,"(CNN) The Swedes have a lot of rich cultural offerings, including a penchant for sensible industrial design and, it appears, a healthy sense of humor. They have recently chosen to exercise the latter at the expense of the President of the United States.
During a rally in Melbourne, Florida on Saturday, President Trump seemed to make reference to a non-existent terror incident in Sweden the night before. Trump later said his comments were ""in reference to a story that was broadcast on (Fox News) concerning immigrants,"" in Sweden.
The damage was already done. Swedes and internet denizens of all nationalities began parodying the non-events with hashtags like #JeSuisIKEA
My prayers and thoughts go to the people of Bøling Grön #JeSuisIkea #lastnightinsweden pic.twitter.com/Gy5whjzI4n
A Swedish news publication, Aftenbladet, published a list of things that happened over the weekend in the country , which included a car chase and a real moose making love to a wooden moose. They published it in English, specifically for the President's eyes, writing: ""Anyway, Mr President, here is what happened in Sweden Friday night."" It was a rather tepid list, save the whole moose thing.
The Swedish Embassy opted for a less humorous, but painfully pointed approach:
We look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies. https://t.co/x5G3euOWRh
The ""Swedish incident,"" as it is being called, is not the first time the Scandinavians have sassed the President.
At the beginning of February, Sweden's deputy prime minister tweeted out a photo of herself signing a referral of Swedish climate law, surrounded by a group of other women representing Sweden's government.

The message here was twofold: One, that Sweden's stance on climate change is far different from the one espoused by the Trump administration.

Sweden, the tweet is saying, does things a little differently.",neutral

Knauss, Trump's older sister, lives just blocks from Trump Tower in the Trump Park Avenue property, public records confirm. She was Trump's maid of honor at her 2005 Palm Beach wedding, People magazine reported at the time. And the first lady called Knauss ""an incredible woman and a friend"" in her July speech at the Republican National Convention.
And the sister of the famously private Slovenian-born first lady is equally private. There are no known appearances of Knauss on the 2016 campaign trail. There are almost no images of Knauss, save for a 2005 appearance alongside her sister at the Mar-a-Lago club on the occasion of a Valentino fashion luncheon for Boys Club of New York. The resemblance between the sisters is unmistakable.
Her Twitter account is private. The office of the first lady declined comment. But many of her Facebook posts are publicly accessible, showcasing a devoted, close relationship between the two. (The New York Post's Page Six first reported on Knauss' account.)
Knauss has shared intimate behind-the-scenes images: a photo of the first lady, whom she refers to as simply ""M""; their mother in 1972; early snaps from Melania Trump's modeling career; and the soccer-themed table setting from nephew Barron's 10th birthday party.

A senior administration official said the meeting is still tentative
(CNN) Ohio Gov. John Kasich is tentatively slated to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, three sources familiar with the plan told CNN Monday.
A Kasich adviser said the White House didn't offer an explicit agenda for the meeting.
A senior administration official said the meeting is still tentative but is likely to be a private sitdown between Kasich, the President and possibly Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. The official described the meeting as long overdue.
Kasich, who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination, was sharply critical of his rival's policies on the campaign trail. He described then-candidate Trump as ""somebody that doesn't understand foreign policy"" and questioned his capability to be commander in chief.
Despite serving as the sitting governor of Ohio, Kasich boycotted the GOP convention in Cleveland. When it came time to cast his ballot, Kasich wrote in the name of 2008 Republican nominee John McCain rather than Trump.

The President clarified his remarks Sunday, posting on Twitter that his statement ""was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.""

Sweden reacts
On Sunday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the President was ""talking about rising crime and recent incidents in general and not referring to a specific incident."" She said he did not mean to say ""last night.""

""The reaction to the tweets has been overall supportive, with a lot of American users saying: 'Hey, it's not just you, we have no idea what he's talking about either.'

Serious concerns
Swedish author Johan Norberg was in Washington for the weekend when Trump was making his speech in Florida.

The statistics
In recent years, Sweden has taken in more refugees per capita than any other European country. In 2015, more than 160,000 people arrived in Sweden seeking asylum, many of those from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.
Sweden granted asylum to 101,025 refugees from 2012 to 2015. That's about 1% of the total population (9.85 million in 2015).
In January 2016, a 22-year-old woman was murdered at the asylum center where she worked, leading to pressure on the government to curb the number of migrants coming into the country.

Professor Jerzy Sarnecki from Stockholm University's Department of Criminology believes much of the criticism of Sweden's refugee policy comes down to an anti-Islam, anti-immigration agenda.
""I'm a sociologist by background. It is obvious that there is a political agenda in all of this,"" he told CNN.
The same could be said of some parts of Sweden's population and political sphere, he added.
""The reason is that the forces in the West are at the moment very much afraid of Muslims,"" he said. ""Through the discussion of crime they are trying to put forward an agenda against taking in the Muslim refugees to the West.""
Crime
According to statistics provided by the Swedish Crime Survey , there has only been a small year-on-year increase in crime.
The number of all reported crimes rose 7% between 2012-2015 while the population increased by 3% at the same time.

443,"Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) President Donald Trump, a newcomer to the White House, is still developing his relationship with the people of Washington. But that's far from the case with the people of Palm Beach -- now the location of his so-called Winter White House -- the long spit of land off Florida's East Coast that the real estate mogul has been frequenting for decades.
Since he purchased the Mar-a-Lago property in 1985 for $5 million, Trump's relationship with the tony city and its residents has ebbed and flowed. He's sued the city, fought with the town leadership and turned local issues into nattional controversies. Traffic caused by Trump's motorcade is the most recent sore spot for the people of Palm Beach and the surrounding area.
But the businessman also saved the iconic estate -- now a private club -- that once sat in disrepair, and his new status is driving attention and business to the town.
It's complicated
Before Trump was elected president, club members ""were excited to see him,"" said Emily Pantelides, the owner of Pantelides PR and Consulting, who helps put on events at the Mar-a-Lago. But now that he spends most of his time at the White House ""people are clamoring to see him.""
""He got into arguments with Palm Beach -- over his flag and how the airports could fly their planes. He was just Trump,"" she said. ""But then, when he threw his hat in the ring, it changed things. Every time something happened with him, the mood at the club and the mood in Palm Beach County was different toward him.""

Not everyone is thrilled with the new Winter White House, however. Sen. Tom Udall, D-New Mexico, in a letter sent Friday to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General , took issue with the arrangements Trump has made to separate his private assets from his public life.
""While he may have a residence at Mar-a-Lago, it remains a for-profit business and allows members access to the club while the President is there,"" Udall wrote.
Trump has visited his winter retreat for three straight weekends. And while he is planning on staying in Washington next weekend to prepare for his first joint address to Congress, businesses in the area say they have been told to expect the President every weekend until May.
The frequent visits allow members access to the upper echelons of America's government. Visitors snap photos of Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter, reading by the pool; take selfies with Steve Bannon, Trump's top strategist, and even get access to the officer who carries the nuclear football, a briefcase that allows the President to launch a nuclear attack at a moment's notice.
Many members relish a Trump sighting now, fawning over the President and his cadre of advisers as they walk by.
And Trump reciprocates the love: When groups host events at his club, the extroverted President could always stop by. Earlier this month, Trump crashed a wedding on the property, offering a toast to the bride and groom.
Trump, after rallying his supporters a few hours north in Melbourne, Florida, on Saturday, swung by a Dana Farber Foundation fundraiser at night, snapping pictures and thanking attendees for coming.
At a time when courts have stalled part of his agenda, NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" has mercilessly mocked his administration and protests seem to pop up every weekend, Mar-a-Lago has become a safe haven for the President.

""It is hard to be president, no matter what your philosophy, and I think he has been incredibly gracious with the club,"" said Page Lee Hufty, a Palm Beach socialite and Trump supporter who sits on the town's Landmarks Preservation Commission. ""He dines with the members, he sits on the terrace with all of the members ... I admire (him) for that.""
Hufty and her other commission members recently approved a request to build a helipad at Mar-a-Lago.
The hearing for the helipad, though, became a venue for Palm Beach residents to air their grievances with Trump's frequent use of Mar-a-Lago. Some complained of the traffic around the club, largely caused by Secret Service checkpoints, while others complained about the prospect of the noise that would be caused by the helicopters.
Hufty confirmed she told one person at the meeting that they needed ""an attitude adjustment"" and dismissed concerns about traffic and noise around the President's visits.
""I think Palm Beachers need to realize this is an honor,"" Hufty said, noting that she sometimes paddleboards out to the Coast Guard boats protecting the club to thank the guardsman. ""It is historic. We need to keep our eye open that. So you miss something. Who cares?""
Friends describe Trump ""ultimately accessible"" in Mar-a-Lago, but that doesn't come without ethical pitfalls.
Democrats and ethics watchdogs questioned how the membership fee doubled to $200,000 after Trump's election. The club could turn into a way for Trump to sell access, watchdogs say, allowing members to pay for the luxury of sharing everything from a terrace to a lobby with the President of the United States, access that most lobbyists would salivate over.
Sarah Sanders, a Trump spokeswoman, responded to questions about selling access Sunday by saying that Trump's visits to Mar-a-Lago make him accessible to ""regular Americans,"" even though the membership fee is roughly four times the median family income, per the US Census Bureau

Exclusive club
One group of people you won't hear complaining about Trump's Mar-a-Lago visits: Members of the club.
Members have been reticent to criticize their club owner publicly once he launched his political career. CNN attempted to contact one dozen members of the club, none agreed to be quoted for this story, and many did not respond to calls and emails.
The reason: Trump is the judge and jury at Mar-a-Lago, and members have grown worried that running afoul of the President could get them on the outside looking in.
""If you are a member there, you aren't going to take a negative position (on Trump), because you would soon be an ex-member,"" said Jack McDonald, the former mayor of Palm Beach and a former member of the club.
McDonald, who was in nonpartisan elected city office from 1995 to 2011, tussled with Trump time to time, but remained a member of his club, using it as a way to entertain dignitaries that visited his city.
McDonald, whose campaigns Trump supported, was at the center of possibly the most notable recent story about Mar-a-Lago: The city's demand that Trump move and lower a 80-foot flag pole the businessman erected in 2006. Palm Beach rules dictate no flag poles can be taller than 42 feet. Trump was fined $1,250-a day to fly the flag. He sued, and the national headlines ensued.
""The day you need a permit to put up the American flag, that will be a sad day for this country,"" Trump said. His lawyers said a smaller flag would look silly, given the ""massive"" size of Mar-a-Lago.
For McDonald, who was then mayor, the story meant constant negative attention, including for him personally.
""I would get lots of negative emails from veterans around the country who thought the town was being unpatriotic,"" McDonald said, himself a veteran. ""He is very good at spinning those kinds of things and all of the sudden it became a national story.""
The case was eventually settled, but the confrontation left some in Palm Beach -- a reliably Republican area of Florida -- with a negative view of the New York business mogul. But members now rarely talk about the confrontation, especially publicly.
""I can't imagine if I were a member of that club today that I would be making any criticism of Donald Trump,"" McDonald said bluntly.
Others backed up McDonald.
""They're almost kowtowing to (Trump),"" said Pantelides, the publicist who has worked on events hosted at the club. ""Part of that is they feel like they're on his turf, even people who maybe don't feel positively about him, they tell him how great he is.""
Historic estate
Marjorie Merriweather Post, the late owner of General Foods, Inc., opened Mar-a-Lago in 1927 after four years of construction, using it as a private residence for decades. When Post died in 1973, she willed the property to the government, hoping it would become the ""Winter White House,"" a place for presidents and government officials to vacation and entertain.
The government, unable to pay for the property's opulent upkeep, let the home fall into disrepair and eventually gave it back to the Post Foundation.
Enter Trump, in 1985, then a New York businessman with money to spend and a profile to raise. He bought the property, used it as a private residence for a handful of years and eventually turned it into a private club in 1995.
Since then, the club has sat as a crown jewel in Trump's real estate empire. Longtime friends and advisers say while Trump loves Trump Tower in New York and his various golf courses around the world, Trump feels most at ease at Mar-a-Lago, where the gregarious business mogul can constantly surround himself with people.
""Mar-a-Lago is as much home to Trump as Trump Tower,"" said Michael Caputo, a longtime Trump adviser. ""In Trump Tower, he is on a high floor, away from people. But Mar-a-Lago is the one place where, if he so chooses, he can be constantly interacting with people.""",negative
444,"Story highlights ""I'm not going to have time to go play golf,"" Trump said
Trump made Obama's golfing a staple of his 2016 critique
West Palm Beach (CNN) President Donald Trump has made visiting his Florida golf courses a near every-weekend habit in the first month of his administration, and his aides are trying to obscure whether Trump is actually golfing during the visits.
One possible reason: Trump was a frequent and vocal critic of President Barack Obama's golf habit, regularly slamming the former president for playing golf with many pressing issues before the country. Trump even suggested during a 2016 event in Virginia, in a knock on Obama, that if elected he was ""not going to have time to go play golf.""
""I'm going to be working for you, I'm not going to have time to go play golf,"" Trump said at the time.
Trump has visited his two golf courses near his Mar-a-Lago estate -- Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach and Trump National Golf Course in Jupiter -- six times in his first month in office.
Aides would not confirm that Trump played golf each time, but through a series of social media posts and interviews with the professional golfers who joined him, it is clear the President golfed during most of these visits. By comparison, Obama played his first round of golf as President on April 26, 2009, at Andrews Air Force Base.

445,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is facing a humbling prospect: The same Washington buzzsaw that frustrated his 44 predecessors can pose significant hurdles for him as well.
In his first month in office, Trump has found the vast government machine can't be reset at a president's whim with the same ease that an executive can manage a business. Rival power centers in the courts, the bureaucracy and Congress can emerge as a threat at any point.
In just the past week, political pressure forced Trump to fire his national security adviser and watch one of his Cabinet nominees withdraw from consideration. Meanwhile, Trump is facing persistent -- and growing -- questions about his campaign's ties to Russia as some fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill become more vocal about their concerns. And legislative victories are hard to come by as congressional Republicans struggle to unify behind policy measures and Democrats form a generally solid bloc of opposition.
The transition from candidate to president is tough for virtually every young administration. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, for instance, had rocky opening weeks as their campaign idealism encountered Washington reality. But Trump's first month in office is especially noteworthy since so much of his trouble stems from self-inflicted wounds ranging from the rushed rollout of his travel ban to his frequent Twitter distractions.
The sense of turmoil surrounding the new administration could undermine a central tenet of Trump's pitch to voters -- that he is a non-politician uniquely positioned to make a deal and get Washington working again.
""Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,"" Trump said last summer when he accepted the GOP nomination in Cleveland. ""I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens.""
Checks on presidential power
He started out in Washington by keeping faith with those beliefs, unleashing a dizzying sequence of executive orders that revealed a determination to wield firm executive power. But the backlash was swift as the checks on presidential power soon activated.
Trump quickly came up against the judiciary when a federal court halted his controversial executive order banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. Despite GOP majorities in Congress, Trump isn't making much progress on his legislative agenda. Opposition is growing in the Senate to paying for his border wall now that Mexico has refused to fund it, CNN's Manu Raju has reported. Democrats infuriated the President by clogging up confirmation of Cabinet nominees.
""That's all they're doing is delaying. And you look at (Senate Democratic leader) Chuck Schumer and the mess that he's got over there, and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay,"" Trump said during an extraordinary White House press conference last week.
Congress is not alone in provoking Trump's ire.
A leaky federal government and intelligence community with which he is locked in a perpetual state of war are also resisting Trump's attempts to exert control over his administration. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus denied Sunday there was dysfunction in the President's inner circle.
""The truth is that we don't have problems in the West Wing,"" Priebus said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""The amount of drama and spin that you read about mostly in the Washington daily gossip rags is unbelievable stuff. And it just isn't true.""
Getting out of Washington
Amid the negative headlines, Trump is getting out of Washington and aiming to speak directly to the American people. He delivered a speech Friday touting his jobs agenda at a Boeing factory in South Carolina and a campaign-style rally over the weekend in Florida . He's slated to deliver an address to a joint session of Congress later this month that will give him one of the strongest venues available to project presidential strength.
But Trump's early stumbles have overshadowed some of areas where he could otherwise claim success. Well-choreographed visits from the leaders of Britain, Israel, Canada and Japan followed a host of executive orders that began to dismantle Obamacare and federal regulations and open the way for cross-continental pipelines, as well as Trump's withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal. His unveiling of Neil Gorsuch as his nominee for the open Supreme Court seat was one of the most flawless moments of his presidency.
Still, controversy can develop in unexpected directions in Washington and exhaust a White House staff in a way that can be detrimental to a presidency. Trump is not the first President to come into power with a team that doesn't seem to quite measure up to Washington's demands.
""I think every administration goes through that,"" Trent Lott, a former Republican Senate Majority leader, said in an interview. ""I was here through Carter, when a bunch of Georgians who thought they were the smartest guys in town arrived and they were going to fix everything.""
""When (Ronald) Reagan came to town, he brought a bunch of Californians, idealistic ideologues who found out pretty quick that they needed help from Jim Baker,"" Lott said.
Through trial and error, Clinton and Reagan learned to work the inside game in Washington to advance what were sometimes seen as outsider political aims. But Trump's attempts to fight back against the restrictions all presidents face could be complicated by another factor -- his idiosyncratic character and political style -- which were an undoubted asset when he reinvented the rules of the presidential campaign but have not yet proven effective in governing.
His constant feuds with enemies, sometimes on Twitter, cast doubt on his temperament, as do his unpredictable eruptions and struggles to stop gloating about his election win. His press conference and weekend rallies helped keep his loyal supporters happy and boosted his own morale. But it seems unlikely that he meaningfully advanced his political agenda.
GOP majorities on Capitol Hill should ensure that big ticket issues like tax cuts and Wall Street reform get done and that Trump can bill them as the kind of ""wins"" he promised would dazzle Washington. And if any politician can get away with such polarizing tactics, it's Trump.
""The President's campaign essentially changed the laws of physics last year,"" said Bill Lacy, director of the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas.
""All the so-called experts have been wrong consistently,"" Lacy said, adding that Trump had changed the way presidents are viewed along with the usual codes of behavior in the White House and Washington. ""Traditionally, a President couldn't do that and get away with it. With this president, that remains to be seen.""",negative

The President clarified his remarks Sunday, posting on Twitter that his statement ""was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNewsconcerning immigrants & Sweden.""

450,"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) A senior National Security Council adviser was reassigned to his old job at the National Defense University, a White House spokeswoman confirmed Sunday, after he criticized the Trump administration's Latin American policies.
Craig Deare was removed from his role as a senior adviser at the National Security Council's Western Hemisphere division Friday and ""sent back to his original position,"" said Sarah Sanders, a White House spokeswoman. Deare had been assigned to the NSC by the Trump administration.
CNN could not independently confirm the account, and Deare did not respond to a request for comment.
Fielding questions about Deare's reassignment, Sanders said that people who don't agree with President Donald Trump should not have a job in his White House.
""I don't think that any person that is there in order to carry out the President's agenda should be against the President's agenda,"" Sanders said during a briefing with reporters in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""It seems pretty silly that you would have someone who is not supportive of what you are trying to accomplish there to carry out that very thing.""
Sanders said she was ""not extending a blanket policy here"" but later added: ""If you don't support the President's agenda then you shouldn't have a job in the White House.""
Deare's reassignment returns him to the National Defense University, an appointed position he's held since January 2001.
Just a few days before he reportedly was reassigned, Deare was the subject of a scathing op-ed in The Miami Herald written by a former colleague of his who called for him to be fired from the NSC.
Martin Andersen, who worked with Deare at the National Defense University, made several personal allegations that he said revealed a ""checkered record of support for and involvement with some of the Western Hemisphere's most notorious human-rights abusers.""
""The National Security Council can do better,"" Andersen wrote.
This is not the first time a senior administration official has been removed from their post because of comments about Trump.
Republican consultant Shermichael Singleton, a political appointee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was fired last week for an op-ed he wrote before the election that criticized then-candidate Trump, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN.
The op-ed, which was published in October, said Trump was leading to low morale within the Republican Party. Singleton, according to a source, was told he was dismissed because of the op-ed.
""We allowed that hostile takeover to happen on our watch,"" he wrote. ""This individual recognized a moment of great disparity in the Republican base and, like cancer, attacked and spread, consuming everything in his path.""
However, some of Trump's closest aides have also criticized him in the past.

""Neither are Trump supporters.""
After telling her story to The New York Times , Kian rejected CNN's Michael Smerconish's suggestion Saturday that she was being ""a bit intolerant.""
""Look at me, I'm brown. I'm a woman.

""I would be more than happy to settle issues with you at protests or in a Congress setting ... but I am not obligated to turn my house into a political battlefield when I come home from work in the evening,"" she said.
Kian also insisted that her ad did not discriminate against ""political differences.""
""It doesn't say no conservatives in my ad, it doesn't say no Republicans, it doesn't say no Christians, it says no Trump supporters. There's a distinction between Republican, conservative and Trump supporters,"" she emphasized.
The difference with Trump, Kian said, is that anyone who supports him ""by all means is a bigot.""
Smerconish interjected: ""I can't buy the notion that says 46% of those who voted in the recent election are by definition bigots.

""Some of them, perhaps. But not all of them. And I guess that's what troubles me is that you're painting with a broad brush.""

454,"Washington (CNN) Some Pentagon officials believe Russia is testing President Donald Trump with aggressive moves across the globe.
Moscow recently deployed a banned land-based cruise missile, dispatched a spy ship up the Atlantic coast and buzzed an American warship in the Black Sea.
""They were likely intended to test the new administration,"" one defense official told CNN.
""The Russians are doing different things to see how the new administration will respond,"" a second defense official added.
The developments raise the question of how the new White House occupant will address Russian assertiveness and whether, after complimenting Russian President Vladimir Putin and playing down Russia's adversarial relationship with the US, Trump will resort to any confrontational responses.
Trump, for his part, dismissed the idea that Russia was testing him and attributed its recent moves to Putin's belief that the new US president was politically constrained and incapable of striking a deal with Russia.
""All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal,"" Trump said during a news conference Thursday.
In contrast, both defense officials noted that Russia's military posture has become increasingly assertive in recent years and assessed that Moscow was likely to test any new administration regardless of its perceptions of the commander-in-chief's latitude to cut a deal.
In the case of the spy ship currently off the coast of Virginia, the defense official said that its mission was likely planned before the election, as the ship left its home port near Murmansk on the Arctic Ocean in mid-December.
Analysts also agreed that the moves were intended to gauge the new White House, but they said the uptick in activity could be in part because they are taking an increasingly dim view of Trump's likelihood of building a warmer relationship with Moscow.
""They are trying to figure out where they stand,"" Magnus Nordenman, the director of the Transatlantic Security Initiative at the Washington-based Atlantic Council, told CNN.
""Moscow is testing and prodding to see where they are,"" he said.
Joerg Forbrig, a Berlin-based expert on Eastern European affairs at the German Marshall Fund, told CNN that Russia's actions ""are just the most recent in a long series of Russian military provocations vis-à-vis NATO member states.""
""That said, the latest posturing is certainly tailored specifically to the United States at its time of transition to a new administration,"" he added.
Both Nordenman and Forbrig said Moscow had stepped back such actions during the transition from President Barack Obama to Trump, but now it was back to pushing the United States.
""The Kremlin paused its hostile actions and rhetoric for a few weeks of US political transition,"" Forbrig said, calling the latest actions a ""return to adversarial normalcy.""
In the case of the Black Sea incident, a spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defense denied that Russian attack jets had buzzed the USS Porter, though the US military released images of the plane flying by the US ship.
According to a third US defense official, the Russian action was ""in direct response"" to recent NATO activities there.
The Russian actions ""are to intimidate Western politics and publics,"" Forbirg said. ""They paint the image of a powerful opponent that is able and willing to challenge Western security.""
Forbirg added that the provocations were likely to continue.
""Russia has lost its hope to reach a better working relationship with the Trump administration than with its predecessor,"" he said.
That echoes Trump's assertion that Russia is taking a harsher stance because it sees limited opportunities for rapprochement with the new US administration.
A spokesman for the Kremlin said his government never viewed Trump with too much optimism.
""Over the period of the last few months, we kept saying that we've never worn rose-colored glasses or cherished excessive illusions,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian media in a Friday morning conference call. ""So we have nothing to be disappointed about.""
Nordenman said the recent Russian actions would only ""marginally"" complicate any effort to improve the relationship unless such provocations continue.
He said the US response could range from ignoring the activity, making a diplomatic protest or positioning more US troops in allied countries closer to Russia and conducting more exercises.
Questioned at the Thursday news conference on how he would respond to the recent Russian activity, Trump responded that it was ""not good.""
But he later elaborated, ""I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response.""
He added, ""So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything.""
At another point he stressed, ""It would be great if we could get along with Russia.""
For now, the US and NATO have continued apace, sending more troops and ships to the region in response to Russia's 2014 invasion and occupation of Crimea and for Moscow's role in the violence in Eastern Ukraine.
Russia's ambassador to NATO, Alexander Grushko, slammed NATO's presence in the region, writing on twitter that ""the decision to increase NATO's naval presence in the Black Sea is another step towards escalating tensions with Russia.""
Moscow has taken steps to bolster its forces in southern Russia and is ""rearming"" its units in Crimea, Grushko added.
Nordenman also said it was ""typical"" for Moscow to attempt these types of actions during major NATO meetings like Wednesday's summit of allied defense ministers in Brussels, Belgium, which was attended by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.",negative
455,"Story highlights The question is whether Trump is violating the Presidential Records Act of 1978
Trump often deletes tweets from his personal account over spelling mistakes
Washington (CNN) Could the President's Twitter fingers pose a legal challenge?
On Friday, President Donald Trump's Twitter account posted one tweet, deleted it and issued another tweet with similar language.
For posterity's sake, the first tweet read: ""The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @CNN, @NBCNews and many more) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American people. SICK!""
It was quickly replaced with: ""The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!""
Deleting a tweet is commonplace -- Twitter does not allow users to edit their messages after they post. The question is whether Trump is violating the Presidential Records Act of 1978, which requires all the president's records be preserved for eventual release to the public on a delayed basis long after the commander in chief leaves office.

456,"(CNN) Univision anchor Jorge Ramos said Saturday that if Barack Obama was the ""deporter in chief,"" then President Donald Trump ""wants to be the deportation czar.""
Trump is ""criminalizing the immigrant population,"" Ramos told CNN's Michael Smerconish.
US Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted multiple raids this week , its first concerted effort under the new administration to arrest targeted undocumented immigrants for deportation proceedings.
""I can't believe a President, who is the son of an immigrant, suddenly wants to close the door after those who came after him,"" Ramos said, referring to Trump's late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born in Scotland.
In particular, the case of Jeanette Vizguerra , an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who has been in the country 20 years, has received widespread attention. The mother of four children found out this week that a stay on her deportation order would not be extended. Worried she'd be arrested, she sought refuge at a church in Denver.
Asked about her by Smerconish, Ramos insisted, ""She's just a mom.""
""Let's not be naive, yes. They have been using fake IDs, fake Social Security numbers, fake drivers' licenses,"" Ramos continued, ""but we are complicit in this.""
Trump tweeted earlier this week that ""(t)he crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!""
But Ramos said the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States come ""because of us.""
""They don't come to go to Disneyland! They don't come here to kill American citizens; they come here simply to make their life better,"" Ramos said.
""They're harvesting the food that we eat, they're building homes where we live, baby-sitting our kids. That's why they are here, Michael.""
The solution, Ramos insisted, is for the President to find ""a legal way"" for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country, ""but he doesn't want to do that.""
""Barack Obama was the deporter in chief; he deported more than 2.5 million immigrants in this country,"" the TV anchor said. ""But now it seems that then Donald Trump wants to be the deportation czar.""",negative

It was a startling observation from a sitting member of Congress against the President of the United States, especially considering McCain is a member of Trump's party.
""I hate the press,"" the Arizona Republican sarcastically told NBC News' Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press."" ""I hate you especially. But the fact is we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It's vital.""

458,"Story highlights White House aides took a hands-off approach to Saturday's event
Trump's presidential campaign was defined by raucous events
Melbourne, Florida (CNN) President Donald Trump, after a month of arduous and, at times, turbulent governing, got what he came for Saturday during a dusk rally here: Campaign-level adulation.
Trump, who just months ago finished campaigning for the office he now holds, was both selling what his administration has done in its first 30 days and trying to change the subject after a chaotic month. The President was forced to fire his national security adviser, struggled to roll out his travel ban and strained to explain a growing story about how members of his 2016 campaign made repeated contact with Russian individuals known to US intelligence.
President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump stand together during a campaign rally on February 18, 2017 in Melbourne, Florida.
Trump, clearly ready for some relief from the confines of Washington and the limitations of the house he ran to occupy, reverted back to his campaign habits, basking in what energized him for months during the slog of his race against Hillary Clinton.
At one point, Trump invited Gene Huber -- a supporter who said he arrived at the venue at 4 a.m. ET to be the first in line for the event -- up to the stage. The man was briefly stopped by the Secret Service before the President urged agents to let him come up and address the audience.
""I wouldn't say Secret Service was thrilled with that ... but we know our people,"" Trump said.

459,"Washington (CNN) Zac Petkanas thought he was done with politics after the 2016 election. He was ready to move into the private sector -- or maybe chase a dream job in the art world.
Then his boss, Hillary Clinton, lost.
Within 48 hours -- infuriated by the Cabinet prospects being floated by Donald Trump's transition team, like Wisconsin sheriff David Clarke for homeland security secretary -- Petkanas had decided he couldn't change careers yet.
""Tuesday was the election. Wednesday I was sleepless and tired and very sad,"" he said. ""And Thursday I got extremely angry.""
Petkanas quickly transitioned from Clinton's director of rapid response -- a role that made him the campaign's chief Trump hit man -- to director of the Democratic National Committee's war room, where he'd lead the party's resistance to Trump's actions.
""The signals that were coming out of the White House lit a fire under a lot of people,"" Petkanas said. ""He re-engaged a whole slew of people, talented people, driven people, to stay in the fight.""
But many of her former staffers -- especially mid-level Brooklyn veterans -- are now on the front lines of the left's anti-Trump resistance.
Many say they're apoplectic over revelations that top Trump advisers were in constant contact with Russians known to US intelligence during the campaign.
Some ex-Clinton staffers have moved into Democratic organizations that are shifting their focus to opposing Trump -- such as Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon, now a senior adviser to Priorities USA; policy adviser Corey Ciorciari, now helming the Center for American Progress war room's policy and research efforts; and Cristobal Alex, Clinton's national deputy director of voter outreach and mobilization, who is now the president of the Latino Victory Fund.
Others are racing to fill the holes in the Democratic Party exposed by November's results, in an effort to help activists newly energized by Trump's victory strike back in upcoming elections, at congressional town halls and more.
Clinton veterans' new projects
One example many Clinton veterans point to: Run for Something, which launched on Trump's Inauguration Day with the goal of recruiting, training and funding first-time candidates for office.
It was co-founded by Amanda Litman, the Clinton campaign's email director, who said in the immediate aftermath of the election, she was looking for a new challenge after several years in online fundraising.
After the election, though, she said she and other Clinton staffers felt like they had failed.
""Once we got over the shock and the sadness and the heavy drinking -- catching up on sleep, cleaning my apartment for the first time in six months -- a bunch of us were talking about different things,"" she said. ""Do you stay in politics because it's incredibly important? Do you leave because you're so cynical and jaded and feel like the work we've been doing doesn't matter?""
Once Litman chose the first option, she leaned heavily on Clinton campaign staffers.
She said Run for Something was built through volunteer efforts of Clinton veterans: The campaign's website director built Run for Something's website for free; Clinton's finance team helped Litman figure out how to raise money. Many of its 1,000 operatives who have volunteered to help future candidates are Clinton alumni.
Litman said friends asked her why she wasn't spending more time going out and relaxing after the election. But she came to feel like she had two options: working, or yelling at the television as news of Trump's transition moves came in.
""One is productive and one scares my dog,"" she said.
Fueling the Trump resistance
Litman met her co-founder, Ross Morales Rocketto, through his wife, former Clinton digital staffer Jess Morales Rocketto -- who is now organizing airport protests and consulting for United We Dream and the National Domestic Workers Alliance in fighting Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven majority Muslim countries.

Other Clinton staffers are filling out the offices of rising Democratic stars like California Sen. Kamala Harris -- who hired ex-Clinton aides Lily Adams and Tyrone Gayle to lead her communications shop. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal hired Clinton veteran Omer Farooque as communications director.
Clinton campaign rapid response team veteran Jesse Lehrich is leading communications for Organizing for Action, while Clinton rapid response spokeswoman Adrienne Watson is the Democratic National Committee's national press secretary.
Another former Clinton communications staffer, Xochitl Hinojosa, is advising former Labor Secretary Tom Perez -- who has called on party members to treat Trump as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell treated Obama, opposing him at every turn -- in his bid for Democratic National Committee chairman.
Jimmy Dahman, a Clinton field organizer in Iowa and then Ohio, has launched TownHallProject.com -- where he and a team of volunteers have made a point of tracking every town hall, coffee meeting or other opportunity for constituents to reach their congressional delegation.
His site's database of upcoming meetings has served as a crucial tool for progressives to identify upcoming events to attend and protest.
Dahman decided to launch the volunteer-driven project after watching a crowd of 100 spontaneously show up at a town hall held by Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado, to protest his support for repealing Obamacare.
""I thought, I wonder how many people feel the same way but didn't know the event exists,"" he said.
Former Clinton deputy national press secretary Jesse Ferguson, senior adviser Leslie Dach and communications department chief of staff Lori Lodes are all consulting for Protect Our Care, the coalition fighting Trump and congressional Republicans over the future of the Affordable Care Act.
Ferguson cited Clinton's oft-repeated Methodist creed -- ""do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.""
""It's one that many of us took to heart,"" he said. ""There's no better example for the idea that you get knocked down, you have to pick yourself back up. She taught us that and, for a lot of the staff, they're going to go and live that idea.""",negative
460,"(CNN) ISIS is spreading ""like cancer,"" Iran is ""the world's top sponsor of terrorism,"" Russia ""is a ruse"" and when it comes to North Korea he'll ""take care of it.""
Those were some of US President Donald Trump's comments from his Thursday news conference.
""I inherited a mess,"" he said, in a reference to the Obama administration's approach to foreign policy.
On Russia: ""Fake news. It's all fake news""
What Trump said:
During the 75-minutes, Trump spoke at length about the alleged links between his administration and Russia.
He roundly dismissed reporting on the subject, criticizing the media for peddling ""fake news"" while saying the ""leaks are real.""
Trump told journalists the ""Russia scam"" was something the media was ""building so that you don't talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks.""
When asked if he directed former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, he said ""No, I didn't."" But he added he ""would have directed him to do it"" because calling countries and counterparts ""was his job.""
Trump also declared ""I own nothing in Russia, I have no loans in Russia, I don't have any deals in Russia.""
On the Russian spy ship that was spotted near the coast of Connecticut, Trump said: ""Hopefully, I won't have to do anything, but I'm not going to tell you.""
Analysis from CNN Correspondent Clare Sebastian in Moscow:
As the topic of Russia becomes more and more prominent in the US, the opposite is happening in Russia.
Most Russian TV broadcasts barely covered the news conference, a stark contrast to the wall-to-wall coverage of the inaugural phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin three weeks ago.
As more mixed messages have been coming out of Washington D.C., the official responses and media coverage in Russia have become more muted.
On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had ""more important things"" to do than to watch a Trump press conference.
When asked by CNN whether Putin was disillusioned by the Trump administration, Peskov said: ""I would like to remind you that over the period of the last few months, we kept saying that we've never worn rose-colored glasses or cherished excessive illusions,"" adding ""we have nothing to be disappointed about"".
On Iran: ""We're not going to stop""

What Trump said:
Trump has been a long-standing critic of the Iran nuclear deal, calling it ""one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody.""
In the news conference, he again accused Tehran of taking advantage of the previous administration and labeled Iran the ""world's top sponsor of terrorism.""
""We're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now, it's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody,"" he added.
Analysis from CNN Correspondent Fred Pleitgen:
The Iranians who support the deal (moderates around Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif) say it is not up for debate and that the US cannot cancel it unilaterally. They also say that Trump not backing it shows that it is good for Iran. Iran's Foreign minister says it will abide by the deal but the US has to do the same.
There are many in Iran, however, who don't like the deal -- mostly the religious conservatives and hardliners close to the Revolutionary Guard. They say Iran gave up too much for it, but they also criticize Trump for his rhetoric.
The Iranians hate the label ""world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism"" and say the groups they support (mostly Hamas and Hezbollah) are legitimate political groups that don't target the US.
It is the US that is aiding terrorism, they argue, by allowing Al Qaeda and ISIS to emerge in Iraq and Syria.
On North Korea: 'We'll take care of it folks'

What Trump said:
Trump offered little clarity on his plan to deal with Pyongyang other than to say: ""We'll take care of it folks; we're going to take care of it all.""
In response to a question about provocations from Russia, and other issues the President has faced this week, Trump suggested that questions about US strategy would not be answered.
""I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea,"" he said. ""And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.""
Earlier this week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un gave orders to test a new ballistic missile, which a North Korean official told CNN was not designed to provoke its neighbors but was a ""gift"" to honor late leader Kim Jong Il.
Analysis:
Writing ahead of Trump's press conference, Adam Cathcart, lecturer in Chinese history at the University of Leeds (United Kingdom) and the editor of Sino-NK.com, said Trump has yet to make much of an impact in North Korea.
""Trump has made a great deal of noise since arriving in office but, paradoxically, his failure to focus on a North Korea policy has created a small space for progress on what the Obama administration considered to be the greatest threat to US security,"" according to Cathcart.
""North Korean state media is at present keeping its powder dry: it has not yet attacked Donald Trump by name or criticized him for anything.""
On ISIS: 'They've spread like cancer'
What Trump said:
During Thursday's press conference, Trump said that ISIS has ""spread like cancer,"" and that ISIS was ""another mess"" he had inherited from Obama's administration.
He told the media that US Defense Secretary James Mattis was ""over there"" working on a plan ""for the defeat of ISIS.""
Mattis is currently attending the Munich Security Conference with US Vice President Mike Pence.
Trump also added that ISIS ""used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world.""
Analysis from CNN's Tim Lister:
What Trump didn't mention was that ISIS as a group and a ""state"" has lost a lot of potency since the middle of 2015 -- a reversal of its initial expansion in the Middle East.
The extremist group has lost more than half its territory in Iraq and Syria. Their stronghold of Raqqa is under pressure and they've lost half of the key Iraqi city of Mosul. They have lost footholds in Libya and their main sources of revenue have been destroyed.
However, they are trying to refashion themselves as an insurgency, a classic terror group by establishing a presence from the jungles of the Philippines to the deserts of Chad.
They are still encouraging terror attacks in Europe and the US but have far less ability to direct and organize such attacks than in 2015.
Essentially ISIS is not spreading -- as in gaining territory -- and is instead looking for new opportunities for its brand far from its core holdings.",negative

This is hardly surprising: during the Obama years, relations between Moscow and Washington went from bad to worse for a number of reasons -- from Russia's annexation of Crimea and military activity in eastern Ukraine to its backing of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to its reported interference in the US election.
Under President Barack Obama, the US strongly condemned each of these acts, and in the case of Crimea placed sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, the desired effect being to hurt the Russian economy.
A Hillary Clinton presidency would have been at best an extension of Obama's policy; at worst, she could have been even more of an anti-Russia hawk than Obama.
In Trump, the Moscow establishment saw a man who might be open to a thaw in the relationship between the two powers.
But in the last few days, a sense of disillusionment has descended upon Moscow and the sense of Russian optimism following Trump's victory has somewhat dissipated.

Only recently, the early days of the Trump administration were being covered in great detail on Russian television. Indeed, not long after his inauguration, the Russian news agency Interfax released a report saying that for the first time since 2011, Putin was not the most mentioned man in Russian media: that honor went to Trump.
More vocal criticism of the new US President is also appearing in Russian newspapers and from some Russian politicians.
This is translated from Friday morning's Komsomolskaya Pravda : ""... one cannot but pay attention at president Trump's self-contradicting [or mutually exclusive] evaluations, which he made for NATO during the elections and today. Trump called the alliance outdated and useless. But less than two months after Trump settled into the Oval Office he expressed the full support of NATO. As they say, there's no way to understand the US president's real position without being drunk.""

There might be something to this. While many in Russia welcomed Trump's victory, this optimism was largely due to things that Trump said about Putin before taking office. It is certainly true that Trump has been louder in his praise (not to mention softer in his criticism) of Putin than vice versa.
Trump's change in tone
But the dramatic change in tone from Trump himself will certainly have been a blow to Putin. Only two weeks ago, Trump was implying to Bill O'Reilly that the US was in no position to preach to Russia. This week: "" Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?""
The confusion of the last week and the mixed messages from Washington may have been enough for experienced heads in Moscow to stop holding out hope of Trump following through with any kind of thaw.

Some will calculate that the last few days may have made Russia too poisonous politically for any US president.
Some in Moscow clearly believe that Trump is being forced to act against his better instincts.
In the wake of Michael Flynn's resignation following an intelligence leak concerning the contents of his conversation with the Russian Ambassador to Moscow, Konstantin Kosachev, the current chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Federal Council, wrote that ""either Trump has not gained the required independence and subsequently (and unsuccessfully) is being backed into a corner, or Russophobia has already infected the new administration from top to bottom.""
If information is being leaked with the intention of undermining any olive branches being offered to the Kremlin, it's clear that earlier Russian optimism was misplaced. Couple this with Defense Secretary James Mattis saying that the US was not ""in a position right now"" to work with Russia on any military matters, and the situation looks bleak from the Kremlin's point of view.
Now might be a politically sensible time for Russia to move away from the idea of a closer relationship between the two capitals. Russia is not used to this level of chaos in Washington. Putin may not have liked Obama, but at least he knew where he stood.",negative

A Hill Republican who visited the White House recently said, ""I was anticipating more chaos, because of media reports and everything, and it was more orderly than I anticipated. It was kind of a normal flow, in and out.""
Part of what the lawmaker learned, and hopes colleagues will see is that some of this is just Trump's management style: ""His operational style is one of sort of three simultaneous conversations, on the phone quick -- it's run and gun.""
Just one week into office, Trump signed his travel ban -- catching even his supporters in the Capitol off-guard. And the persistent drip of stories about ties between Russian officials and Trump's campaign has grown into a steady stream in the last two months, finally claiming former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn in the process.
At times, the national focus has been on actual conservative legislative priorities.
House and Senate Republicans have been working steadily behind the scenes at the Capitol, hammering out the details of the proposals they have long sought -- repealing the Affordable Care Act, overhauling the tax code -- and Trump promised them he would sign. And conservatives have applauded his nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court.
When asked if he was concerned about the persistent questions about Russia and other problems from the White House, House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions pointed out Thursday that most of the questions he was getting were on their priority: repealing Obamacare.

Now House and Senate Republicans will head back to their districts for the first serious break since the start of January, where most of them will be met by well-organized groups of protesters swarming their town halls.

Every day that they're obsessed about the developing scandal around Flynn and the context of the Russian government, it makes it less likely they're going to be able to get a repeal of the Affordable Care Act or a trickle-down tax cut through Congress,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat.
""It'd be a risky bet to believe that this administration is going to get radically more functional over the course of the next four years,"" Murphy added.
Senate Democrats are doing everything they can to contribute to that dysfunction.
In lieu of actual filibusters -- Democrats ended the ability to filibuster typical appointments in 2013 -- they turned to committee walkouts and long, overnight debates, on many nominees.
Although Democrats are outnumbered 52-48 in the Senate, they've scored some points -- like Sen. Elizabeth Warren's breaking of Senate rules to lure McConnell into a late-night fight.
""We have 30 hours post-cloture debate that happens no matter what's happening over here. In one way, we've got plenty to do, but it's certainly not helpful to have the distraction,"" said Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican and routine critic of Trump's actions.
Asked if he thought Republicans would have been struggling with overnight debates and walkouts if Jeb Bush or Rubio had won, Flake said, ""No. I think it's clear we wouldn't.""
The Gorsuch pick
The nomination that may be the most normal is actually Gorsuch.
Trump's presentation of Gorsuch was so exceedingly normal, by White House standards, that it looked like a clear reset after the failure of the travel ban.
Yet even the daily, routine tours of Gorsuch through the Senate offices since then have underscored the almost daily stories of White House dysfunction -- and frequent confusion in Congress about what Trump wants.
Even Hill Republicans' shelter from the Trump storm -- Vice President Mike Pence, a de facto member of Congress, complete with a new office below the House chambers -- took a beating this week after it was discovered Trump kept him in the dark for two weeks about Flynn's misleading of him.
One Republican lawmaker close to the Trump administration floated Pence as a bright spot for Republicans, but then cringed when reminded he had been kept out of the loop for two weeks.
""Yeah. So I would imagine there are some tough conversations happening,"" the Republican said.
Reconnecting with Hill allies
Before his press conference, Trump invited his closest Hill allies to the White House -- members who endorsed him early on in his campaign when the establishment was still on the fence about the wildcard nominee.
According to sources in the meeting, there was a fair bit of reminiscing about the campaign and the connections made in those early days. No talk of voter fraud though, an issue Trump has repeatedly brought up at meetings with lawmakers as he maintains without evidence that he, not Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote.
""It was very positive,"" a source in the meeting said. ""He talked about health care and getting that going.""
While some on the Hill fear that Trump's White House is divided, sources in the meeting said the administration strongly pushed back against that narrative. At one point, sources in the room said the administration made light of the news coverage of the West Wing.
""They feel like the image being painted or portrayed is not correct,"" a source in the room said.
From the meeting, sources say Trump is still very committed to ensuring he gets his border wall. One member in the meeting suggested that a double fence might work well enough, but Trump pushed back.
Supporters inside the meeting say he touted a bedrock of his campaign -- the border wall -- and emphasized it would be a wall, not a fence.
""He was going to build it,"" the source said.
That's a fight yet to come.",negative
466,"Story highlights Jake Turx said he was surprised by Trump's reaction to his question about anti-Semitism
Turx recounted an earlier exchange he had with Trump, ""he was very friendly""
(CNN) A Jewish reporter who was called a liar and told to sit down by President Donald Trump after he asked about the rise of anti-Semitism in the United States says he is still hopeful.
""The Trump campaign and transition and now administration have been extremely forthcoming in reaching out to the orthodox Jewish community,"" Jake Turx, a reporter with Ami Magazine told CNN's John Berman on ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""I remain extremely confident that they are going to sit down and meet with community leaders and figure out what can be addressed.""
Turx told Berman that his question to the President was to simply get his administration's position on how they will try to curb anti-Semitism. Turx prefaced his question by saying that he has not seen anyone in his community that would accuse Trump or his staff of being anti-Semitic.
""See, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question, and it's not,"" Trump interrupted at his press conference on Thursday.
Turx said he was caught off guard by Trump's reaction to his question.

467,"Reeling from a week that included the firing of his national security adviser, the withdrawal of a Cabinet nominee and persistent questions over contacts between his campaign and Russia, Trump is aiming to regain control of his nascent administration by putting himself back in the spotlight.
The centerpiece of the effort: a return to the scorched-earth politics that served him so well on the campaign trail. That was on display Thursday when Trump cranked up the political theater during an extraordinary news conference that transferred the seething air of grievance from his campaign rallies to the ornate splendor of the East Room of the White House.
He'll continue his campaign-style reboot Saturday with a rally in Florida, reuniting with the devoted supporters who view Trump as a political crusader dedicated to the obliteration of Washington's elites.
Through it all, he's breaking free from the confines of his office and the formality of the White House to fire up the free-wheeling, media-bashing brand of attack-dog politics that powered his stunning takeover of the Republican Party and the presidency.
Though much of official Washington was stunned by Trump's news conference, the President knew exactly what he was doing, seeking a relaunch for his administration and a pivot away from stories of a White House in disarray.
""We had an interesting news conference, didn't we?"" Trump told lawmakers and reporters during a bill signing ceremony later Thursday, clearly relishing his performance.
Since taking office, Trump's pugnacious persona has at times appeared stifled by the formal surroundings of the White House. He hasn't always appeared completely relaxed, for instance, in his joint news conferences with foreign leaders.
But alone on the stage Thursday, gesturing behind his podium and locked in combat with reporters, he was in his element, ensuring the event will go down as one of the most memorable presidential news conferences in history.
Something on his mind
Trump's ostensible purpose for the event was to announce Alexander Acosta as his new pick for labor secretary after his previous nominee, Andrew Puzder, withdrew over ethics concerns. But it was soon clear that Trump had something else on his mind and set off on his tour de force with the air of a man who wanted to get something off his chest.
""I turn on the TV, open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine,"" Trump said.
Following a tumultuous few weeks that included a chaotic roll out of his travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations and reports of fierce infighting between rival power centers in his West Wing, Trump's declaration of resounding success seemed at odds with the facts.
But Trump's strategy -- diverting attention from his bad week, rallying his political base and putting on a show that would drown out incessant questions about his campaign's connections to Russia -- quickly became clear.
""This is what he enjoys doing. He recognizes that this is why he won,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, explaining Trump's snap decision to schedule a news conference Thursday morning.
Another senior Trump aide, Kellyanne Conway, declared Trump was back in his ""natural habitat.""
""Pressers are his sweet spot,"" she said.

Such political pyrotechnics have helped Trump before. In slamming his media inquisitors Thursday as ""fake news,"" he was reengaging with his grassroots army that he used to great effect during the campaign.
""This is a press conference like no other from a President like no other,"" Andre Bauer, a Trump supporter and former South Carolina lieutenant governor, told CNN International. ""Straight talk is what the people wanted and straight talk is what the people are getting.""
But the question for Trump is whether such tactics can sustain a presidency, a role that is far more complex than that of an election-year candidate.
""The overall impression was this was a raucous, combative, sometimes unhinged press conference that recalled moments in the campaign but I think left an awful lot of people asking what kind of reality is he in here,"" said David Gergen, an adviser to four presidents who is now a CNN senior political analyst. ""When he described his administration as a finely tuned machine, I would hate to see a broken down one.""
Questions about Russia

Trump did little to alleviate the most potentially dangerous crisis assailing his White House -- CNN reported this week that high-level advisers close to Trump were in constant communication during the summer campaign with Russians known to US intelligence.
Questions about his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom most people in Washington view as a dangerous enemy, are being fueled by a drip, drip of disclosures and reporting. That Russian cloud over the White House, which led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn this week, is unlikely to lift until the President provides a full accounting of unanswered questions.
Trump said during the news conference that as far as he knew, none of his staff had been in contact with Russian officials. That was a long way from the kind of fulsome answer that will make the drama go away.
A sign that Trump's White House trouble could continue: Ret. Vice Adm. Bob Harward turned down the President's offer to succeed Flynn, reluctant to take the job because the White House seems so chaotic, a friend of Harward's told CNN.
In a statement, Harward noted the job would require ""24 hours a day, seven days a week focus and commitment to do it right.""
""I could not make that commitment,"" he said.

Trump may have other long-term political problems. It's not clear that feuding with reporters on national television, however satisfying, will help him forge progress on some of the issues that helped him win the presidency, such as reviving manufacturing industry and repealing and replacing Obamacare . His tactics could ultimately prove distracting from achieving those policy goals.
While he confounded most analysts by consolidating blue collar votes in previously Democratic Midwestern states on Election Day, he has done little to bring the country together since then. That is reflected in his presidential approval ratings, many of which are now hovering around 40%.
But one Republican aide on Capitol Hill insisted the news conference would help Trump -- at least for now.
""It plays well for Trump,"" the aide said. ""It's not a long-term solution to the problems he's facing, but I think it's an effective distraction for 24 hours. Meanwhile most in the GOP will stay quiet because they still see the opportunity they have to accomplish things they've been waiting for eight years to accomplish.""

468,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump widened his search for a new national security adviser this weekend amid concerns in Washington that the forced resignation of Michael Flynn leaves the White House unprepared to face any sudden foreign policy crisis.
Flynn's short tenure ended when he was asked to resign after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his pre-inauguration calls with the Russian ambassador.
Trump interviewed several candidates to replace Flynn on Sunday, according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.
""He did several interviews and in-depth meetings that are still ongoing as of this afternoon talking to different candidates for the national security adviser position,"" she told reporters.
On Saturday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that Trump planned to speak to former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, acting national security adviser Gen. Keith Kellogg, West Point Superintendent Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who directs the Army Capabilities Integration Center, and ""potentially more"" candidates.
Sanders confirmed those four men had been interviewed, adding: ""We may have some additional names tomorrow and he may also meet with a couple of those people again.""
Two other candidates, former Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal and former CIA Director David Petraeus, are no longer in the mix, sources told CNN Friday night. The front-runner for the post, Vice Adm. Bob Harward, dropped out of consideration apparently over concerns that he could not bring his own staff to the National Security Council.
Sanders refuted that Sunday, saying reports that candidates were told they could not bring on their own teams were false and that it has ""been made clear"" to the new candidates ""that they can bring on their own teams.""
There were signs of strong support inside and outside the administration for Bolton. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told CNN in an interview that the foreign policy veteran would make a ""very, very, strong"" national security adviser because he understands the threat from ""radical Islamic terrorism.""
Bolton, a controversial figure who had to secure a recess appointment to serve as President George W. Bush's ambassador to the United Nations after failing to win Senate confirmation, is emerging as a strong favorite among political staffers on the NSC.
While there is a lot of affection for Kellogg, the current NSC chief of staff, supporters believe that Bolton brings a mix of anti-establishment credentials that fit Trump's political temperament and in-depth knowledge of Washington and how the foreign policy process works, a senior administration official said.
The official said Bolton is close to both CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Pence, who is ""extremely powerful at this point"" and so may have some sway on who gets the job. In the end, however, it will be up to Trump to decide who he is most comfortable working with. Should Bolton get the job, political staffers want Kellogg to stay on as NSC chief of staff.
The sense of limbo is causing concern among lawmakers and foreign policy experts who understand how the National Security Council corrals rival foreign policy power centers in the government and its crucial role at a time of crisis.
""There is no doubt after the departure of Flynn and everything that led up to it that the NSC is in a little bit of chaos,"" Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois told CNN Friday. GOP Sen. John McCain also questioned the state of White House foreign policy earlier in the week.
Every presidency brings change and uncertainty to American foreign policy. But Trump's arrival in the White House has been especially disorientating for US allies, since he adopted positions on the campaign trail -- for example, questioning the value of US alliances in Europe and Asia that have underpinned post-World War II peace -- that appeared to threaten wholesale upheaval in the international system. Adding personnel uncertainties to that mix is underscoring the sense of instability that Trump has brought international relations.
As they await their new boss, national security staffers are hunkering down and forging ahead with their work.
One senior administration official strongly refuted claims that the NSC was in chaos, arguing that it is functioning exactly as it should be, despite Flynn's departure, and is primed for any crisis that would arise.
""It is dead wrong,"" said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation. ""The NSC was instrumental in the rollout of the Venezuela drug kingpin designation, the NSC arranged a meeting with Venezuelan dissidents with the President. The NSC is instrumental in setting up, prepping and briefing all the President's foreign leader calls of which there are a couple every day.""
""Everyone is carrying on as normal,"" the official said, pointing to a string of successful meetings between Trump and foreign leaders in recent weeks.
Harward's decision not to take the job revealed the fact that potential candidates will likely have to agree to keep on staffers already brought into the NSC.
In a statement to CNN, the former Navy SEAL cited family reasons for his decision. But a friend of Harward said he was reluctant to sign up because the White House seems so chaotic. A Republican official told CNN that Harward was not convinced he would be able to bring in his own staff.
Trump's top aides have made clear that candidates that most of the top political appointees who came in with Flynn will stay -- in a bid to avoid disarray.
""We are in an unprecedented situation,"" the official said. ""Somebody coming in is going to have to understand it is not going to be the way it would have been had they been picked November 10 and had a whole transition to pick their staff.""
The visits of British Prime Minister Theresa May, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, however, sent reassuring signals to US allies.
One senior member of one of the delegations said that Trump and those around him had pleasantly surprised their visitors with evidence that they were beginning to understand the complexity of foreign policy and managing alliances, despite their inexperience.
Internal tensions
Normally, a vacancy for a national security adviser would spark intense jockeying for position throughout the national security establishment in Washington -- given the job's proximity to the President and central role as the White House's foreign policy first responder.
And Trump's failure to find a quick replacement for Flynn is shining a spotlight on the internal tensions in his administration.
Harward's decision revived Washington scuttlebutt about the extent to which political influences are weighing on the national security team in the White House following Trump's executive order reserving a spot for his controversial adviser Steve Bannon in NSC principals committee meetings.
""If I had been in his position, being offered the top job in national security, a job that anyone in that profession would want, I would want to make sure I had control over the staff and that the NSC was not being influenced by the President's political advisers,"" said Tony Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser for President Barack Obama.
""I suspect that Bob Harward, looking at this job, looking at this possibility would have said, 'Yes, but that has to stop,' and if he didn't get those assurances, he is probably right not to do it,"" Blinken told CNN's Brooke Baldwin.
Bannon is not the only member of Trump's political team who has carved out a sphere of influence on foreign policy. The President's son-in-law Jared Kushner emerged as the key interlocutor between foreign leaders and the new president during the transition period and early in the new administration, diplomats said.
Trying to keep security council stable
The official said the White House is concerned that the council -- an organization that is already in an uneasy position after Flynn's early exit -- would be further destabilized if the top staffers in the organization were asked to resign in order to make room for the next national security adviser's staff.
""They don't want to see big changes at the NSC and therefore that is going to be a condition for anybody taking the job,"" the official said.
But military officers especially, one White House aide said, bring with them a host of people, so encouraging staff stay could run counter to what the next National Security Adviser would want.
Harward's decision not to accept the job also raised eyebrows because of the unspoken military code that when a President calls, service personnel salute and accept the mission.
Who has Trump's ear?
The Defense Department has also welcomed the somewhat looser oversight being conducted by the Trump White House, which has had a lighter hand so far than the former Obama administration.
That new regime has also been noted at the State Department, where one official said that there was little ""connective tissue"" between Foggy Bottom and the West Wing.
Former Obama administration State Department spokesman and White House Communications Director Jen Psaki warned that a prolonged vacuum on the NSC would soon start reverberating around the world.
""If you are working in an embassy or in a diplomatic role for countries around the world, you are wondering who has Trump's ear, who is speaking on behalf of the United States,"" Psaki said on CNN International on Friday.
Still, one of the ironies of the uncertainty surrounding the NSC is that foreign policy -- at least as far as it relates to visits by key foreign leaders -- has been one of the smoothest areas of the administration so far.

469,"Bright red hats emblazoned with the words ""Make America Great Again"" dominated the crowd celebrating in front of the Capitol. The hats were a powerful reminder of the dramatic change in power about to unfold in Washington and became prized possessions for some of Trump's supporters.
Mark Stroman bought five hats from a street vendor for friends back home in Los Angeles, acknowledging the political divide the apparel represented.
""I think that they brought some divisiveness,"" Stroman said. ""They made a great divide between Democrats and Republicans but I think they made people pay attention, they made people wake up.""
Campaign swag is easy to dismiss, but Trump's hat captured how his candidacy disrupted and divided the country. Like many things in Trump's campaign, it's hard to conclude there was a grand strategy that led to its success. But its connection with voters -- for good or bad -- is undeniable.
Here's the story of how the hat became one of the most powerful symbols in modern American politics.
Owning a slogan
There were no marketing experts or design research involved in the initial idea for the hat, according to former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
""I think somebody actually sent us a sample,"" Lewandowski told CNN. ""They brought that sample to Donald Trump and he said, 'I like it, let's tweak this, let's do it differently.'""
Lewandowski said they tried out different prototypes, different size fonts and styles before they landed on a keeper. After that, the hats were kept on Trump's plane at all times.
It was a little more than a month after he announced his candidacy that Trump first donned the hat in public at a campaign event. When he made a much-publicized trip to Laredo, Texas, in July 2015 to visit the US-Mexico border, the hot weather necessitated a more casual look than his usual suit and tie.
""Just for the sweat factor and other things, he chose to wear the hat,"" Lewandowski said.
At the time, Trump was caught up in a tornado of controversy, from questioning Sen. John McCain's status as a war hero to speculation about running as a third-party candidate and a Border Patrol union backing out of the visit at the last moment.
A crush of reporters waited for Trump in the small terminal of the airport when Trump's plane touched down.
""He came around the corner and we all went, 'Oh!,' CNN's Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, who covered the event, remembered. ""I really remember it vividly because it was like, 'Oh, of course, he's the master marketer. Why wouldn't he put it on a hat?'""
Trump briefly visited the border, and talked to the cameras three separate times, holding forth on his signature issue of immigration. In every shot, his brand was impossible to miss.
Bash was also surprised to notice Trump was wearing white golf shoes, eliciting a ""crunch crunch"" noise as he walked out to a podium.
Donald Trump visits the US-Mexico border wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat and golf shoes.
The hat itself may have been a fluke, but the slogan had a deeper history with Trump.
He started using the phrase as far back as 2011. It took on new meaning for Trump, however, in the wake of Mitt Romney's defeat in 2012. In both style and substance, Trump felt Romney failed to project a positive vision of American strength. Just six days after that election, Trump signed paperwork to trademark the phrase ""Make America Great Again.""
""He was in that chair -- that iconic chair he has in his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower -- and he looked up and he said, 'My slogan is going to be Make American Great Again,'"" Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide who helped lay the groundwork for Trump's run, told CNN. ""He looked up at the ceiling with a smirk on his face, and he said, 'And watch, everybody's going to love it.' He was right.""
Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, criticized the slogan as harkening back to an abstract time in American history, calling it a ""cruel fantasy."" The phrase has been used in the past by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and even Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton.
But in the history books, the slogan will belong to Trump.
Trademark applications typically take a long time to process. Trump didn't receive the ""Make America Great Again"" trademark until July 2015, just in time for the trip to Laredo.
Disruptive technology
""It's just a disruptive technology,"" Lewandowski told CNN of the campaign hats. ""People who weren't involved in politics, that didn't have a political background, wanted to show their support for something different and their way to do that was to buy hats.""
The hats are sold in a range of colors, but Trump has shown an affinity for the red hat, as well as the white hat and a camo-style hat with orange font.
Trump was struck by the ubiquity of the hats, from rallies in rural America to formal GOP donor dinners, Lewandowski says. And yet, for all its resonance with supporters, the design almost seemed like an afterthought.
""It was un-designed,"" Lindsey Ballant, a designer and adjunct professor at the Maryland College of Art, told CNN. ""It didn't represent what one thinks of when you think of traditional politics in terms of visual messaging, and that's essentially what Trump was as well.""
The type is default, Times New Roman, the color design is basic, and the style, sitting oddly high on the head with a slender rope stretching across the front, matches the hats Trump has long worn on his golf courses.
""In contrast, Hillary's campaign was incredibly thought out. It was elaborate. There was a whole system driven around the simplicity and the beauty of the logo mark,"" Ballant says of Trump's opponent's campaign.
Trump's campaign knew they wanted to capitalize on the popularity of the hat, spending more than $2.8 million on hats from Los Angeles-based company Cali-fame, even as political operatives mocked them.
""It invited attacks from the left in a way that fit right into what I think the Trump campaign and the Trump organization wanted, which is a clash of those two political civilizations that they believed worked in their favor,"" Republican strategist and CNN contributor Kevin Madden said.
Lewandowski said it wasn't easy to find a US company to produce the hats. They sell for $20-$30 and cheaper knock-offs from countries like China and Bangladesh are common.
""Mr. Trump signs a lot of hats and he knows the difference,"" Lewandowsi told CNN. ""He'd say to me, 'You know, out of 10 hats I signed, eight of them are one of the knock-offs.' He's like, 'How do we get those guys?'""
Donald Trump signs a hat after speaking at a campaign rally.
Cali-fame produces the hats now sold on Trump's website, and the ones seen on his head, but Trump's campaign also bought some hats from companies like Ace Specialties LLC and Maxim Advertising, according to finance reports.
If one wanders into the small store in the basement of Trump Tower, there is a corner devoted to campaign swag, featuring the classic hat as well as new versions unveiled after the election. The cashier there is careful to turn away any potential buyers who are not US citizens, as a purchase of the hat is considered a campaign contribution for Trump's re-election.
The hats are a physical connection between Trump and many of his rural and working class supporters, but they also continue to be a target for anti-Trump sentiment, from the many parodies of the hat, to protesters burning one at the inauguration.
No matter what emotion it inspires, the hat, once described by The New York Times as an ""ironic summer accessory,"" has cemented its place in history. Both a red and white hat sat near the stage, enclosed in glass, at Trump's election night party.
A worker cleans the glass case around the ""Make America Great Again"" hats on display at Donald Trump's election night party in New York City.
""If I were ever going to design a Trump presidential library, and somebody said what's the artifact you most want, I would say the original hat of Donald Trump's under glass,"" presidential Douglas Brinkley told CNN. ""The whole campaign can be summed up in his collected Twitters, and that ball cap.""",negative
470,"Story highlights Trump touted announcements from several companies announcing expanded operations in the US
It was a scripted and issue-focused version of his combative defense of his presidency on Thursday
North Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) President Donald Trump credited his young presidency Friday with creating a business climate that is incentivizing American companies to keep their businesses in the US and invest in American manufacturing.
""Already, American industry is roaring back,"" Trump said at a Boeing factory here during a ceremony unveiling the US aerospace company's newest jet. ""Jobs is one of the primary reasons I am standing here today as your President and I will never, ever disappoint you, believe me.""
Trump touted announcements from several companies announcing expanded operations in the US or new manufacturing plants -- including some originally announced before he took office -- and promised more of the same as he tackles his agenda of lowering taxes, stripping government regulations and implementing protectionist trade measures to incentivize US manufacturing.
It was a scripted and issue-focused version of the combative defense of his presidency he served up during a nearly 80-minute long news conference a day earlier at the White House.
And it marked a return to jobs-oriented rhetoric he offered during his populist campaign for president, including here in South Carolina, where his victory in the Republican primaries sent shockwaves through the political establishment.

471,"Washington (CNN) The administration of President Donald Trump remains largely unfilled four weeks into his presidency, with just 34 of nearly 700 key Senate-confirmed positions even having a candidate announced.
According to data from the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service hosted by The Washington Post, Trump has 14 officials confirmed by the Senate and 20 others are awaiting a vote, out of 696 top leadership positions in the administration.
Trump's pace only lags slightly behind that of former President Barack Obama, at least in terms of selections. By February 17, 2009, Obama had nominated 38 members of his team. He added six more by the end of February.
Obama did have more nominees confirmed, however. Twenty-six members of Obama's team had been confirmed by this date in 2009, a dozen more than Trump. Like the President, Obama's party was in charge of the Senate at the time.
Trump has named every Cabinet and Cabinet-level official, as well as a handful of deputies and ambassadors. Obama had not named any ambassadors but had many agencies' deputies selected and several board positions filled, including at the Federal Reserve, Council of Economic Advisers and the Council on Environmental Quality.
Unlike Obama, Trump also had a Supreme Court vacancy at the beginning of his term. He nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch, whose hearings are scheduled for next month.
But as Trump continues to search for more names to fill out his nascent administration, he's also already seeking replacements.
Former national security adviser Michael Flynn -- a position that doesn't require confirmation -- was forced to resign this week after admitting that he misled Vice President Mike Pence on whether he discussed sanctions with Russian counterparts before the inauguration. Flynn is not expected to face charges but was asked to step down after losing the President's trust.
Meanwhile, the former top candidate to replace Flynn, retired Vice Adm. Bob Harward, turned down the position. Harward and the White House cited family reasons, though sources close to Harward told CNN he was concerned about chaos at the White House and that he would not be able to select his own team.
Trump has already named a replacement to be secretary of labor after the first nominee, fast food executive Andrew Puzder, withdrew his nomination in the face Republican opposition. Florida International University School of Law Dean Alexander Acosta was named less than 24 hours after Puzder withdrew.
The nominee for secretary of the Army, Vincent Viola, also withdrew from consideration, citing trouble disengaging from his business ties. A replacement has yet to be named.
Trump also may have difficulty filling slots because of either concerns from Republicans who would otherwise serve a GOP administration and hard feelings from the Trump camp towards the DC establishment that fought him.
Some Republicans have quietly spoken of not wanting to take jobs in the administration, or of concern that they're on blacklists for past criticism. Many were not fans of Trump during the campaign.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Elliott Abrams, a veteran of the Reagan and Bush administrations, was nixed by Trump for the No. 2 job at the State Department after he found out about criticism Abrams made of Trump during the campaign. Until then, he had been a leading contender for the still unfilled position.
After Harward's withdrawal, Trump is renewing the search for a national security adviser, as retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg fills in the position for the interim.
Trump has blamed the slow pace of filling his Cabinet on Senate Democrats, who have used procedural measures to force the full length of time allowed for nearly all nominees, slowing down the process considerably.
Unable to stop any nominees without Republican support, given the move to a 51-vote threshold by former Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid, two committees' Democrats resorted to refusing to show up for a committee-level vote to deny a quorum, forcing Republicans to reconvene and pass the nominee by suspending the rules the following day.
""I think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet,"" Trump said during a wide-ranging press conference on Thursday. ""I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately. ... That's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at (Senate Minority Leader Chuck) Schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they'd be better served by approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good.""
Democrats have countered that Trump's nominees have had trouble getting their paperwork in and have instead blamed delays on the transition.",negative

473,"Jerusalem (CNN) US President Donald Trump has casually dumped five decades of US policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , saying he won't insist on a two-state solution and that he would simply ""like the one that both parties like.""
His comments give fuel to growing interest in a one-state solution as negotiations to create a sovereign Palestinian state have stalled in recent years.
Trump also called for an Arab-backed peace process -- an idea that's been periodically revived over the past two decades without producing results. But such a process insists on a sovereign Palestinian state.
What exactly did Trump say?
Speaking to reporters Wednesday alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said he was ""looking at two-state and one-state"" solutions and that he could ""live with either one.""
""I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two but honestly, if Bibi and if the Palestinians -- if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I'm happy with the one they like the best,"" he said, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.
But Trump toed the line on previous US administrations' stance on Israeli settlements, telling Netanyahu directly that he would like Israel to hold back on building more settlements homes ""for a little bit.""
Trump emphasized that he and Netanyahu had known each other for some time, calling him a ""smart man"" and a ""great negotiator.""
""I think we're going to make a deal. It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That's a possibility so let's see what we do,"" he said.
What is the two-state solution?
The idea of the two-state solution sounds simple enough -- an Israeli state next to a Palestinian state, existing side by side in peace.
But progress on the goal has been far from easy and has stalled in recent years. The most recent round of negotiations fell apart in April 2014 with Israeli and Palestinian leaders blaming each other. The two sides have failed to come to an agreement over several issues central to the solution.
Both claim parts, if not all, of the holy city of Jerusalem as their capital. They dispute where to draw borders and they continue to clash over Israeli settlements in occupied territory. In addition, what happens to the Palestinian refugees who fled what is now Israel after the 1948 war is a point of contention. The UN estimates that there are 700,000 Palestinian refugees in the world.
A spate of clashes broke out in 2015 between Israeli security forces and Palestinian protesters.
The two-state solution has been the goal of the international community for decades, dating back to the 1947 UN Partition Plan, and many nations say that it is the only way out of the conflict.
It would recognize a 1967 demarcation line known as the Green Line to partition Palestinian and Israeli land, subject to land swaps based on negotiations, and it would divide Jerusalem between the two states.
Netanyahu endorsed the idea of two states in 2009 under pressure from the Obama administration, but on Wednesday he sidestepped questions about whether he still supports it.
He said instead he wanted to avoid ""labels"" and talk ""substance"" -- the need for Palestinians to recognize Israel as a Jewish state and the need for Israel to have overriding security control.
Many in his right-wing government are celebrating his comments, seeing it as an end to a future Palestinian state, calling for more construction of settlement homes and some even calling for a partial or full annexation of the West Bank.
What would a one-state solution look like?
From Israel's perspective, a one-state solution means it would annex either part or all of the West Bank and Gaza.
But this forces Israel to make a decision, since there are approximately an equal number of Jews and Arabs throughout Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. If Israel gives Palestinians a right to vote, then Jews would soon be a minority, since the Arab population is growing faster as a demographic than the Jewish population.
If Israel doesn't give Palestinians the right to vote, Israel would remain a Jewish state but would no longer be a democracy. Israel's critics say it would become an apartheid state, with one set of rights for Israelis and another set for Palestinians.
Why are settlements a problem?

Settlements are Israeli cities, towns and villages in the occupied West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. They are considered settlements and not Israeli residential areas because Israel is widely considered to be an occupying force in the territories. It is land that Palestinians, along with the international community, view as territory for a future Palestinian state.
Just before finishing his term as US Secretary of State, John Kerry said Israel's settlement policy was leading to a future of ""one state and perpetual occupation"" He slammed the arguments of right-wing Israeli officials who claim settlements are aimed at bolstering Israel's security.

Virtually the entire international community supports a two-state solution. In the Middle East, most countries support the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, put forward by Saudi Arabia. The initiative was adopted unanimously by the Arab League.
But there are militant factions that reject Israel's right to exist and support a one-state solution -- but one called Palestine, not Israel. Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza have both called for the destruction of Israel.
Many in Israel's right-wing support a one-state solution -- they envisage that state as a Jewish state. While some are willing to give the Palestinians full citizenship and equal rights, others would confer upon the Palestinians a lesser autonomy. Palestinians, who have their own national aspirations, criticize the latter system as akin to apartheid.
Many Israelis and Palestinians on the far-left -- as well as far-left Europeans and Americans -- also support a one-state solution, but in a very different form. They envision a secular state for all citizens, regardless of religion, culture or ethnicity. Most Israelis recoil at this idea because it's seen as removing the Jewish character of the country and a way of eliminating the state of Israel by non-military means.
Some Palestinians who prefer the one-state solution are frustrated with the failure of the Oslo Peace Accords and see no hope in continued peace negotiations. They feel the international community is not taking concrete steps in changing the reality after nearly 50 years of Israel's military occupation of the West Bank. They would rather force Israel to take full responsibility for security in the West Bank, as was the case before the Oslo accords.",negative
474,"Story highlights Trump said Thursday he has tried to set up a meeting between himself and Cummings

But the Maryland Democrat insisted to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that never happened.

""He wanted it, but we called, called, called and I can't make a meeting with him. Every day, I walk and say, 'I would like to meet with him,' because I do want to solve the problem.

475,"Career officials at the agencies most involved in the process, however, are set to recommend a fence—one that will cover only about half the length, CNN has learned.
CNN spoke to more than two dozen sources and experts, including some who are part of high level discussions with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
While no plan has been approved or finalized, DHS is currently working on recommendations that Secretary John Kelly will present to Trump.
President Trump has been looking at various blueprints with his advisers, a senior administration official told CNN. He could ultimately insist on a concrete wall stretching across the entire border, as he has promised. It would be a far bigger and a vastly more expensive project, and any plan would need to be sent to Congress for funding approval.
JUST WATCHED What history tells us about Trump's wall Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What history tells us about Trump's wall 01:22
A preliminary internal report by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), viewed by CNN, outlines various options in phases and uses the words ""fence"" and ""wall/fence.""
It also includes a final phase calling for covering more than 1,080 additional miles of border with new barriers which would stretch from coast to coast, with a price tag of $21.6 billion. But sources called that option ""only fantasy,"" and said it is not being seriously considered by officials close to the discussions within the Department of Homeland Security.
Other phases or proposals in the internal report were far more modest, and cheaper.
One senior U.S. Border Patrol official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN that it's crucial to be able to see through a border barrier. ""I'm not calling it a wall because we are talking about a fence that we can look through. That's what we need.""
Another senior U.S. Border Patrol official told CNN, ""I think fencing has worked for us in the past, but you never want to have a barrier in place that will obstruct your vision, that prevents you from seeing the other side of the border.""
Any White House push for a full-length concrete wall would receive little support from career officials within CBP, according to Seth Stodder, a former DHS official who focused on border security under the Obama and Bush administrations. ""These are law enforcement agencies. When the White House says 'Jump,' they will say 'How high?' But there will be whispers from them to Congress saying not to do this,"" Stodder told CNN.
Some sources told CNN one of the biggest challenges will be convincing the president to modify his campaign promise of a solid wall structure. ""It's going to be made of hardened concrete, and it's going to be made out of rebar, and steel,"" Trump said at a December 2015 rally. He repeated the assertion most recently at a news conference in January of this year when he shot back at a reporter who asked him about the fence: ""On the fence—it's not a fence. It's a wall. You just misreported it. We're going to build a wall.""
Sources tell CNN Trump's vision of a concrete wall is unrealistic, because of cost, timing, and safety.
As one official put it: After the experts convince Trump the wall will not work and it will be a fence, ""the White House will just have to figure out a way to spin it [to the public.]""
A concrete wall also poses environmental problems, such as flood risks and hazards for endangered species.
Leading plan
One plan being seriously considered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, according to sources, calls for upgrading significant portions of the 654 miles of fencing that is currently along the border, as well as the construction of new fencing along key areas.
That option would include about 150 miles of new fence in areas still to be determined, along with about 15 new miles of fencing around San Diego and El Paso, and another 12 new miles around the Rio Grande Valley, which includes Brownsville, Texas. The plan also calls for 272 miles of replacement fencing.
The total area of border covered by fencing under this plan would be about 831 miles, which includes fencing already there now. Under that plan the total barrier between the United States and Mexico would then cover about 831 total miles of a nearly 2000 mile border, still not even half, according to sources.
The new and replaced fencing would cost about $5 billion.
Fence along the U.S.-Mexico border in Brownsville, Texas.
The new fencing would resemble some of the strong fortifications built around the Brownsville, Nogales and San Diego areas. They're called ""bollard-style,"" or ""PV1,"" or ""Normandy-style,"" and essentially involve thick reinforced bars or slats of steel that stand about 18 feet tall, often 6-by-6 inches wide and filled with rebar and concrete for strength, and typically set 6 feet below the ground to prevent tunneling under them.
While the sources did not all agree on the precise length or location of new fencing, all told CNN that protecting the border will require more hi-tech surveillance and more arrests. And all but one of the more than two dozen sources CNN talked to agreed that a concrete wall is not a good idea.
Many officials stressed the need for more border agents, with one saying, ""Technology and fencing can only play a part. Personnel have to be in place to respond.""
At a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing last week , Secretary Kelly joined several other witnesses who all said that fencing often provides more security to border agents and appeared to back off from using the word ""wall.""
When asked by Rep. Filemon Vela, a Democrat from Texas, whether ""President Trump's promise to build a 2000-mile big beautiful wall"" was ""a viable option,"" Secretary Kelly replied, ""The President, Congressman, has asked me to take a look at what we need at the Southwest Border and come up with recommendation to him. Yes, there are many places that we need some types of physical barrier right now backed up by men and women at the border protection.""
The White House also seems to have given itself some wiggle room in its official definition of the wall. President Trump's executive order on the border wall reads, ""It is the policy of the executive branch to secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.""
The order goes on to specify later that ""'Wall' shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other simeilarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.""
Miami developer Jorge Perez, who has worked with Trump for years, received an email from the Trump Organization with a note from the president himself asking him to get involved with the border project. CNN viewed the email on the condition that it not be shown. It contained sketches of two walls, a primary wall and a secondary wall, with a security road in between. Perez, a Democrat, said he's not going to be involved in the border project.",positive

Both the House and Senate approved the measure through the little-used Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to roll back any regulation the Obama administration instituted from June to his last day in office. Republicans have been using it to target regulations they regard as a burden on economic growth and businesses.
Trump's move Thursday may be just be the beginning of undoing some environmental protections. A source close to the administration tells CNN that soon after Scott Pruitt is sworn in as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the President will take executive action directing Pruitt to make good on campaign promises related to climate change policy and regulations. This source says the timing for exactly when the President will act and how many executive orders there may be is still being worked out.
The White House is also still trying to determine if the President's action will apply only to the EPA or whether it would be a broader order affecting agencies throughout the federal government, according to the well-placed source.

477,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump gave lengthy news conference Thursday, a last-minute addition to the schedule, where he announced his new selection to lead the Labor Department, Alexander Acosta. His back-and-forth with reporters touched on everything from his critique of the media, his Electoral College margin of victory, the workings of his administration, former national security adviser Michael Flynn's resignation and more.
Here are the most memorable lines:
On how things are going
On leaks, news
On picking his next question
""I want to find a friendly reporter.""
On false claims about his Electoral College win's spot in history
""I was given that information, I don't know.""
On his own speech
""I'm not ranting and raving, I'm just telling you you're dishonest people.""
On Obamacare
Obamacare , they fill up our alleys with people you wonder how they got there.""
On reports about Russia contacts
""You can talk all you want about Russia -- which was all a fabricated fake news ... It is all fake news. It is all fake news.""
On Flynn
""I don't think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right.""
On why Flynn was fired
""The thing is he didn't tell our Vice President properly and then he said he didn't remember... that just wasn't acceptable to me.""
On an alternative career
""I'd be a pretty good reporter.""
On dealing with Russia
""The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone will say, ""Oh, it's so great, it's so great. That's not great.""
On nuclear holocaust and Russia
""Nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They are a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. But if we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that is as good thing, not a bad thing.""
On the travel ban
""We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, we had a bad court.""
On violence in Chicago
""There are two Chicagos, as you know. One Chicago that is incredible, luxurious and safe. There is another Chicago that is worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about and that you talk about on the news.""",negative
478,"Story highlights ""I would say this: You've got to put someone somebody in charge,"" LePage said.
""We got to tell him that the TV show's over and he's gotta move on now,"" LePage added.
(CNN) Republican Gov. Paul LePage, a supporter of President Donald Trump, said Thursday morning that too many people are vying for power within the White House and that the President should stop treating it like a TV show.
""The thing I'm sensing is that there's three or four chiefs at the top,"" the Maine governor told Newsradio WGAN.
""I would say this: You've got to put someone somebody in charge.""
LePage said Trump fostered too much competition, which was causing dysfunction.
""In his case, too much competition. Everybody's fighting to be that No. 1 person. You're gonna have a lot of slip ups. I've met Donald Trump, I think he does promote some competition. He brings that business aspect to it. We got to tell him that the TV show's over and he's gotta move on now,"" he said.

479,"Story highlights ""It was a wild press conference,"" Tapper said
Here are Tapper's comments in full
(CNN) CNN's Jake Tapper responded with astonishment Thursday after President Donald Trump's White House news conference -- ostensibly called to announce his choice of labor secretary -- turned into a sweeping attack on the press and defense of his administration.
Here are Tapper's comments in full:
""It was a wild press conference. And I think that, first of all, purportedly the purpose of it was to introduce his new secretary of labor nominee, Alexander Acosta. He talked about (CNN correspondent) Jim Acosta more than he talked about Alexander Acosta. He talked about Hillary Clinton more than he talked about Alexander Acosta.
""He spent the first part of his remarks talking about accomplishments that he thought the media, the fake media, whatever he wants to call us, we're not paying enough attention to. But then, instead of focusing on these accomplishments and offering an optimistic, positive view of what he's doing for this country, it was an airing of grievances. It was Festivus. It was complaints about the media. At one point, he said the leaks were real, but the news is fake, which doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
""He said things that were not true. Peter Alexander from NBC pointed out one of them when (Trump) said he had the biggest electoral victory win since Ronald Reagan. That's not true. Clinton, Clinton, Obama, Obama, George H. W. Bush, all were bigger.

480,"Story highlights Andrew Puzder was Trump's first pick to leader the Labor Department
He withdrew his nomination Wednesday
(CNN) President Donald Trump announced Thursday his plan to nominate Alexander Acosta as labor secretary, who, if confirmed, would be the first Hispanic member of Trump's Cabinet.
Trump told assembled reporters Acosta is going to be ""a tremendous secretary of labor.""
The nomination comes one day after Andy Puzder, Trump's first pick to lead the department, withdrew his nomination.
Trump said that Acosta ""has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed."" The comment was an apparent reference to his administration's struggle to get all of their nominees through the Senate.
""I have wished him the best, we just spoke and he is going to be a tremendous secretary of labor,"" Trump said. Acosta -- the son of Cuban immigrants -- was not at the event with the President.

481,"Story highlights Trump said Thursday that his administration will issue ""a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people"" next week
The original three-judge panel retains control of the case and the travel ban remains on hold
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump vowed Thursday to roll out a new immigration executive order next week that will be tailored to the federal court decision that paused his travel ban.
""The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision,"" said Trump during a news conference, referring to a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that blocked his travel ban earlier this month.
Meanwhile, the Justice Department told the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that it did not need a larger panel of judges to rehear its failed emergency challenge to a lower court's temporary suspension of Trump's executive order on immigration at this time, because a new order is on the way. The Ninth Circuit agreed Thursday evening to put any rehearing of the matter on hold for now.
The Justice Department wrote at length in a 47-page about the ""seriously flawed"" Ninth Circuit ruling from last week, but neverthless said: ""(r)ather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.""
""In so doing, the President will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially time-consuming litigation,"" it added.

482,"(CNN) The presidency has changed Donald Trump -- at least when it comes to his take on the morality of government leaks.
In the days before his election, Trump the candidate touted a damaging -- and false -- leak reported and subsequently retracted by Fox News. Parroting the initial claim, he told supporters at a rally in Jacksonville that FBI agents said their investigation into Clinton's use of private email server was ""likely to yield an indictment.""
It was hardly an outlier.
Trump during the campaign routinely applauded Wikileaks for its role in disseminating the contents of internal communications stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign. He even publicly encouraged the Russians to ""to find the 30,000 emails (from Clinton's server) that are missing.""
Asked by CNN's Jim Acosta at that July 27 news conference whether he would call on Russian President Vladimir Putin to quit any potential interference in the election, Trump demurred.
Then he explained why Americans shouldn't get hung up on the source of leaked information.
""It's not even about Russia or China or whoever it is that's doing the hacking,"" he said. ""It was about the things that were said in those emails. They were terrible things, talking about Jewish, talking about race, talking about atheist, trying to pin labels on people. What was said was a disgrace.""
In other words, Trump argued, it was the news -- and not the sources -- that mattered.
DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schulz was forced to resign in the aftermath of the DNC hack. Internal emails showed officials discussing ways to undermine Sen. Bernie Sanders' primary.
Again, Trump crowed with delight.
""E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!"" Trump tweeted on July 24, after she abruptly stepped down on the eve of the Democratic convention. ""Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her 'servant' was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all!""
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2016
A little more than three months after the DNC episode, Trump defeated Clinton in the general election. With his new job came quickly evolved view on the value of leaked information. He picked fights with the Intelligence Community almost immediately.
When CNN reported on January 10 that Trump and President Barack Obama had been briefed on claims by Russian operatives that they possessed compromising information about Trump, the president-elect lashed out.
""Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ""leak"" into the public,"" he tweeted the next morning. ""One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?""
Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ""leak"" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017
While Trump disputed the details of the unverified dossier, he never denied the substance of the CNN report, which stated only that he and Obama had been presented a summary of its details.
Trump has followed a similar pattern in his response to the series of bombshell revelations that led, on Monday night, to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn.
According to multiple reports from a number of news outlets, including CNN, Flynn had not only discussed US sanctions with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office, he had misled Vice President Mike Pence , who denied it on his behalf.
Another leak revealed that the former acting attorney general, Sally Yates, had informed the White House weeks earlier that Flynn was potentially vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians.
""The level of trust between the President and Gen. Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday, explaining why Flynn had been sacked. ""The President was very concerned that Gen. Flynn had misled the vice president and others.""
But Trump on Wednesday deflected from the substance of the information and attacked the sources.

""General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he had been treated very, very unfairly by the media. As I call it, 'the fake media,' in many cases,"" he said during a joint press conference with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. ""From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked. It's criminal action. Criminal act.""
His comments followed a morning tweetstorm that declared ""the real scandal"" was not Flynn's behavior or the White House's response, but that ""that classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy.""

Trump, clearly angered by barrage of unauthorized disclosures, had come along since the Al Smith Dinner in October. In his remarks at the typically light-hearted white tie fundraiser, he played leaks for laughs.
""I wasn't really sure if Hillary was going to be here tonight because, I guess, you didn't send her invitation by email,"" Trump joked . ""Or maybe you did, and she just found out about it through the wonder of WikiLeaks.

483,"Story highlights Trump sparred with the press for over an hour
He touted his own poll numbers, victory over Hillary Clinton and discussed cable TV ratings and panel discussions
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump launched an extraordinary denunciation Thursday of his critics, complaining he inherited a ""mess"" and slamming stories that his campaign was constantly in contact with Russia as ""fake news.""
Trump held court during a news conference that lasted an hour and fifteen minutes, carving out a stunning moment in modern American political history. He displayed a sense of anger and grievance rarely vented by a President in public -- let alone one who has been in office for just four weeks.
""I have never seen more dishonest media, frankly than the political media,"" Trump said, later slamming leaks to the press from the intelligence community -- some of which led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn.
""The leaks are real. The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake,"" Trump said.
While it was a marked contrast with the normal dynamics of a presidential news conference, the East Room show was vintage Trump. He touted his own poll numbers, victory over Hillary Clinton and discussed cable TV ratings and panel discussions.

484,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump thrived on drama during his campaign -- but signs of disarray in a White House beset by controversy and internal tensions are exposing the downside of his signature style.
Trump's fast start is now a memory as intractable controversies bear down on his administration from inside and out, consuming political capital just at the moment when he seeks to enact his agenda at home and abroad.
""As far as national security is concerned, this White House is in disarray,"" Republican Sen. John McCain told CNN Wednesday.
McCain is not alone in raising alarm bells about how the White House's scattershot focus could eventually make Americans less safe.
In stunning comments for a sitting member of the top military brass, Army Gen. Raymond ""Tony"" Thomas warned at a symposium in Maryland Tuesday that ""our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon because we're a nation at war.""
The warnings come as the West Wing becomes inexorably more entwined in political dramas and internal staff intrigues that threaten to detract from Trump's crucial first 100 days.
Mushrooming drama over the Trump campaign's alleged connections to Russia, which claimed the scalp of his national security adviser Michael Flynn, is working its way relentlessly closer to the President himself.
Trump is refusing to answer questions about a CNN report that some of his advisers were in constant communication with Russian operatives at a time when Moscow was trying to tip the US election his way. But his silence means the furor grows by the day, and he can't put the distracting saga to rest.
""This is a major distraction, even if you are not the President or the vice president -- it affects the entire building. It affects the entire national security apparatus,"" said Mark Lowenthal, a former CIA assistant director of Central Intelligence for Analysis and Production.
""It is very hard to focus on your work, to focus on the things you should be working on when you have all of this swirl going on around you,"" Lowenthal told CNN International.

Fresh questions were raised in another area Wednesday -- over the administration's congressional and vetting operation -- after the White House lost its first Cabinet nominee , Labor Secretary pick Andrew Puzder, over ethics issues.
Each day brings a gusher of controversy and conflicting messages that drown out the successes Trump has managed to rack up so far, including his well-choreographed Supreme Court pick and visits by leaders of Britain, Japan, Canada and Israel that sent reassuring signals abroad.
In Trump's three-and-a-half weeks in power, internal tensions have generated a year's worth of unflattering headlines that some critics feel detract from the work of the presidency.
Pence questions
On Wednesday, for instance, there were new questions about the influence of Vice President Mike Pence , who only learned that Flynn had misled him about his calls to the Russian ambassador from published reports -- a full two weeks after the President was informed by the Justice Department.
Pence had put his reputation on the line to defend Flynn on television after he was explicitly told the former national security adviser had not discussed sanctions on Russia with Moscow's ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.
An administration source said that though the relationship between Trump and Pence has not been soured by the issue, Pence wanted to know which adviser informed Trump but decided ""maybe we shouldn't tell the guy who went on the record as the face of the administration.""
But a separate administration official denied Pence is focused on this, saying he has moved past it.
""The vice president is in close coordination with the President and senior staff. The vice president has moved beyond this topic and is focused on the future. Any claims to the contrary are false,"" this administration official said.
Another White House official said: ""The White House is denying CNN reporting the Vice President Pence is searching for answers about Flynn.""
The incident is sparking concerns among Republicans who see Pence as a crucial steadying influence in an inexperienced West Wing team.

""I don't know who's exercising the most influence, but I know the White House would be very well-served to listen to Mike Pence a lot, and I hope they do,"" Republican Sen. John Thune said.
Another major destabilizing influence is Trump himself, who looms over the administration as a mercurial figure supercharging controversies with Twitter rockets and still appears obsessed with his own political fortunes.
On Wednesday, for instance, he answered a question from an Israeli journalist about anti-Semitism in the US by boasting about the size of his Electoral College win.
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a striking warning to the President in an interview with the Weekly Standard , saying that Trump's approval rating would be 10 to 15 points higher if he stayed on message.
The Senate Majority leader told the magazine that the President's tweets and comments make it ""harder to achieve what you want to achieve.""
Palace intrigue
The competing power centers and crossed lines inside Trump's inexperienced inner circle are also contributing to a growing sense that the new administration has lost control over its own story.
The maneuverings of Trump aides like Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trump's influential son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are sowing instability throughout the White House and doubts outside.
""Who's making the decisions? No one knows who is making the decisions. Obviously it is not the national security adviser. Is it Mr. Bannon? Is it the 31-year-old?"" McCain said, in an apparent reference to Miller.
In recent days there have been signs that the White House is trying to quell the almost daily drip, drip, of palace intrigue stories in the press.
While Priebus has been the target of attacks in conservative media, senior administration officials and sources close to the White House insist his job is safe. They admit the White House has suffered some missteps and, as chief of staff, some of the blame may lie with Priebus.
JUST WATCHED Tapper calls out Trump on conspiracy theories Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tapper calls out Trump on conspiracy theories 03:45
But they point out the challenges of operating in the current environment: A demanding (and vocal) boss, an administration largely staffed with newbies and colleagues all vying for more power.
Another source, who knows Trump well from the campaign, reinforced that message, pointing out that the President demands a relentless diet of excellent performance according to his own standards, making him a grueling boss to work for.
If the President is at all irked with this chief of staff, he's not showing it. Earlier this week, Trump declared to reporters, ""Reince is doing a great job.""
""Not a good job -- a great job,"" Trump added.
Bannon, Trump's chief strategist, is also making an attempt to put to rest stories that he and Priebus are at loggerheads.
He told CNN's Dana Bash Wednesday that he was ""livid"" with a report on Breitbart News, where he used to be the executive chairman, that suggested Priebus might soon lose his job.
""The story is totally untrue. Reince is doing a great job. I couldn't ask any more from a partner,"" Bannon said.
Still, a source who has talked to both Priebus and Bannon in the last week said that while Bannon had nothing negative to say about Priebus, the White House chief of staff ""badmouthed"" Bannon to this source over the phone.
This source chalked it up to Priebus' relative insecurity, whereas Bannon is comfortable in his post and knows where he stands with Trump.
JUST WATCHED Trump counters Russia connection reports Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump counters Russia connection reports 02:26
Bannon is perhaps the closest Trump has to an equal in the White House. And it is clear that he is behind some of the disruption -- critics would say disarray -- that is emanating from the administration.
The President and Bannon have compatible world views, and a mutual desire to shatter norms and face off with institutions. Trump also respects Bannon, in part because of his successful business background, a source familiar with their relationship said.
The source also noted that Bannon might be the one person in the West Wing who could stand up to Trump.
""Sometimes he needs to hear, 'Hey, step away from that,' and I think Bannon is the guy that can do that better than anybody in there,"" one source said. ""He's the most grown up guy in the room.""
In that respect, Bannon is a useful counterweight to Kushner, the source said, adding, ""Ultimately your son-in-law is not going to tell you things you don't want to hear all the time.""
Still, the husband of Trump's daughter, Ivanka, is also emerging as a force in his own right in the White House. Multiple sources said that Kushner was a key conduit between Trump and foreign leaders, and has been playing an important role in his diplomacy in recent weeks.
He is also a fixture at Trump's almost nightly working dinners in the White House residence that draw Cabinet members, military brass and lawmakers.
But while Kushner has been a steadying force on foreign policy, sometimes the President's advisers are responsible for the fomenting the kind of disarray that worries McCain and Thomas.
Miller, for instance, went on Sunday talk shows and renewed Trump's claims that millions of illegal voters backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in November's election.
His claims dumfounded the Beltway media and Trump's opponents and sowed another of the controversies that some Washington observers worry drag the White House's focus away from crucial issues.
But the person who mattered most thought his performance was outstanding.
Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017
""Congratulations Stephen Miller - on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!"" Trump tweeted.

485,"ANNOUNCE HIS NEW NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF LABOR
FEBRUARY 16, 2017
SPEAKER: PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
[*]
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He's a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well.
And so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of labor.
And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition.
Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, ""never Trump."" And Paul just left and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time. It's very, very important to me.
So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.
I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time. We've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.
And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That's always a possibility.
I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.
A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it -- much of the media doesn't get it. They actually get it, but they don't write it. Let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, ""Oh, that's good."" Now it means, ""That's good for jobs."" Very different.
Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I'm making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit -- a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's OK, too.
TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.
I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking -- and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure; we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort - not all the time - and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say - they're honest and fantastic.
But much of it is not a - the distortion -- and we'll talk about it, you'll be able to ask me questions about it. But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The middle east is a disaster. North Korea - we'll take care of it folks; we're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.
Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand.
We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs. It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He's over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world.
They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer - another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism, and we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now, it's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody. I've ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I've had great from Congress, generally.
We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my - I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it; I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it's depleted - it won't be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I'm standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.
We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.
Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They're so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that's what I've been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.
And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I'm here following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222, 230's impossible.
270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media's trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.
And - but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida five o'clock on Saturday and I heard - just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T.V., open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine- tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my cabinet approved.
And they're outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who's there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can't get approved. How do you not approve him? He's been a colleague - highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We're waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about and we can't let that happen.
So, if the Democrats who have - all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.
I'll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks - in the weeks coming. We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We're going to make trade deals but we're going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We're going to have one on one deals.
We've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it's many, many years. And then at the end of the process -- they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.
Now, they may be rejected with me but it's going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it's going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don't want the jobs going to other countries. We've imposed a hiring freeze on non-essential federal workers. We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.
We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody's ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say ""let me see your regulations"" and they're fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental - all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It's very important to me. But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.
We've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible.
We've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We're becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer.
We've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general -- now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we're starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either non-existent or a joke.
We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day.
The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order.
I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.
In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is -- that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.
We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.
TRUMP: And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C., I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.
We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is's disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing.
So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It's already happening. But big league.
I've also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.
You look at Rex Tillerson. He's out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.
Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.
Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.
Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.
Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here.
General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.
Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.
Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we're naming.
Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we're not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.
And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he'll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.
This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week.
Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there.
And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.
Mara (ph), Mara (ph), go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)
TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.
He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem.
And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- that they know nothing about it; they weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call.
It's all fake news. It's all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal -- I think it's very important -- the illegal, giving out classified information. It was -- and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.
I'll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that's -- I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call. All of a sudden, it's out there for the world to see. It's supposed to be secret. It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.
Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I'm saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it?
You know why? Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.
Yes, go ahead.
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)
TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, ""I don't think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right."" He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, ""Huh, that's fine."" That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to -- he didn't just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He's doing the job.
You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.
But he didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.
Yes?
QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was -- it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren't even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part. They -- I hadn't spoken to them.
I think the one person -- I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.
The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that.
That's Mr. Manafort, who's -- by the way, who's by the way a respected man. He's a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody -- people knew that. Everybody knew that.
So, these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.
TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.
He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that's the extent.
Russia is fake news. Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.
As you know, Mike Pompeo has -- has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.
And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time's story, yesterday. And it talked about -- these are (ph) front page.
So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.
So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I've never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.
But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?
That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.
And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.
OK, go ahead.
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph), or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 (OFF-MIKE).
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Yeah.
QUESTION: Obama (OFF-MIKE) 426 on (OFF-MIKE). So why should Americans...
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: ...I'm skipping that information, I don't know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin.
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) why should Americans trust you (OFF-MIKE) the information (OFF-MIKE)?
TRUMP: Well, I don't know, I was given that information. I was given -- I actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that's...
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes?
QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did -- whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?
What-- what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.
TRUMP: We are.
QUESTION: Can we ask what you're going to do and also, we've heard about a -- a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?
TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they're in position so I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.
The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he's offered his services and you know, it's something we may take advantage of. But I don't think we're need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.
As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.
It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said ""well I don't see"" -- to me, he was doing the job.
The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said ""doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there."" But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.
That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So -- and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.
QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks -- on the leaks, sir...
TRUMP: ...Go ahead. Finish off then I'll get you.
QUESTION: I'm sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You've said twice today...
TRUMP: ...Yes, we're looking at them very -- very, very serious. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies -- I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.
We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act. You know what I say, when I -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.
But I said ""you know, it doesn't make sense. That won't happen"" but that wasn't that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who's a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said ""that's terrible that it was leaked"" but it wasn't that important. But then I said to myself ""what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?""
What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very -- you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don't want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.
So I'm dealing with Mexico, I'm dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the ""Washington Post"" and gets put into the ""New York Times"" and I'm saying ""what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?
We got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty.
QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?
TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it. Because there's nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.
It's very important to me and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true and, you know, over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm OK with that. But I'm not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.
I don't watch it any more because it's very good -- he's saying no. It's OK, Jim (ph). It's OK, Jim (ph), you'll have your chance. But I watch others too. You're not the only one so don't feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be -- I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody's ratings are right now but I think that actually -- I think that'd actually be better.
People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that's right. I don't know, Peter (ph), is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I'd appreciate it -- again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.
TRUMP: I think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately.
I'm going forever and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for. And that's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they'd be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good.
And sometimes -- I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that's OK. That's fine. But I think it would -- I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics.
And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)
TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information. They're giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.
Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine -- seriously -- can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric -- you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We'll do you next Jim, I do you next(ph).
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) clarify --
TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure
QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador --
TRUMP: No, I didn't.
QUESTION: -- prior to your -- TRUMP: No, I didn't.
QUESTION: -- inauguration.
TRUMP: No, I didn't.
QUESTION: And then fired him --
TRUMP: Excuse me.
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)
TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.
I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job. And it came out that way -- and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I've watched many other people say that.
No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it. OK? Jim?
QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don't hate you. I don't hate you.
TRUMP: OK.
QUESTION: So, pass that along --
TRUMP: Ask -- ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job. OK?
QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir --
TRUMP: Well, that's -- well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.
QUESTION: It's pretty good right now, actually.
TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John.
QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time --
TRUMP: I was OK with it.
QUESTION: -- you said -- you said that you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails. I'm wondering, sir, if you -- TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.
QUESTION: Then(ph), your(ph) numbers(ph) were off too.
TRUMP: No -- no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that.
QUESTION: If -- if I may ask you, sir, it -- it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during(ph) the campaign --
TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready?
QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that --
TRUMP: No -- no, but let me do one at a time.
QUESTION: If I may as a follow up?
TRUMP: Do you mind?
QUESTION: Yes, sir.
TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you're talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you're talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.
He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information. But in one case, you're talking about classified -- regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.
I don't want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn't even in the papers.
Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she -- and she should have reported herself.
Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job."" QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there's a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?
TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look...
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: You know what it is? Here's the thing. The public isn't -- you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved. I'm involved. I've been involved with this stuff all my life. But I'm involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not. I just see many, many untruthful things.
And I'll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word ""tone."" The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that -- the tone is such hatred.
I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It's the most honest.
But the tone, Jim. If you look -- the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets...
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network.
Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I'm amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know.
I -- I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's -- it's brutal.
Now, they'll take this news conference -- I'm actually having a very good time, OK? But they'll take this news conference -- don't forget, that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK?
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people. That's for sure. But I'm having a good time.
Tomorrow, they will say, ""Donald Trump rants and raves at the press."" I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it.
But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, ""Donald Trump rants and raves."" I'm not ranting and raving.
Go ahead.
QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup...
TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have -- let him have a little bit more?
Sit down. Sit down. We'll...
(CROSSTALK)
QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...
TRUMP: I'm changing it from fake news, though.
QUESTION: Doesn't that under...
TRUMP: Very fake news.
QUESTION: ... I know, but aren't you...
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: Go ahead.
QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news.
TRUMP: And you're not related to our new...
QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.
TRUMP: I looked -- you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.
QUESTION: I'm sure you checked that out, sir.
TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it -- I said -- they said, ""No, sir."" I said, ""Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.""
QUESTION: But aren't you -- aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don't like ""fake news""? Why not just say it's a story I don't like.
TRUMP: I do that.
QUESTION: When you call it ""fake news,"" you're undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important.
TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here's the thing. OK. I understand what you're -- and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, ""Wow, that's going to be a great story."" And I'll get killed.
I know what's good and bad. I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what's good. I know what's bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive -- sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make OK. They'll even make it negative.
So I understand it. So, because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who's saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me.
Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?
Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go - as an example, you're CNN, I mean it's story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running - this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph).
You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I'm saying ""here's my chief of staff,"" a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right?
We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some - all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job. And I said to myself, you know - and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said ""you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires."" I mean, they're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame because he'd rather be working on healthcare, he'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph).
I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there's a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know - you know, whatever reason. But - and I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair and that's why the public sees it. They see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.
And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead.
QUESTION: (inaudible) ...for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And second...
TRUMP: ...I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public - that's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.
Now tomorrow, you'll say ""Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible."" It's not terrible. It's good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.
Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?
Hillary Clinton - that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who's going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said ""I know politically it's probably not good for me."" The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles off shore right out of the water.
Everyone in this country's going to say ""oh, it's so great."" That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can - now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But - but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.
Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said ""you know."" He's sitting behind his desk and he's saying ""you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It's going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story."" OK?
And that's a shame because if we could get along with Russia - and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.
QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)?
QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you...
TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare. We're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.
So we'll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March, mid- March. And after that, we're going to come up, and we're doing very well on tax reform.
Yes?
QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.
TRUMP: OK.
QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel -- the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.
TRUMP: Not good.
QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.
TRUMP: Not good.
QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign ...
TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, ""Hey, we're back to the old games with the United States; there's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us."" Because the -- you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, ""Oh, isn't that wonderful."" But I know you well enough.
Then you would say, ""Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn't have done that."" Look, all of the...
(CROSSTALK)
QUESTION: I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those...
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a re-set. It failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people.
Go ahead.
QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?
TRUMP: I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.
Yes, I think that I've already...
QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?
TRUMP: No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.
Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.
Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.
If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no up-side. We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.
They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
QUESTION: So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are...
TRUMP: Who did I say is not good?
QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they're not good.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: No, it's not good, but they happened.
QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine...
TRUMP: They all happened recently.
No...
(CROSSTALK)
QUESTION: ... this country's ability to work with Russia?
TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they're doing because they're doing the same thing.
Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK?
But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the re-set. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I'm close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She's close to Russia.
QUESTION: Can we...
TRUMP: I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.
QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?
TRUMP: I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response. I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months. ""We are going to attack Mosul in four months."" Then three months later, ""We are going to attack Mosul in one month."" ""Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.""
In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things, you're going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that. So I don't have to tell you. I don't want to be one of these guys that say, ""Yes, here's what we're going to do."" I don't have to do that. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.
TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything, but I'm not going to tell you.
OK.
QUESTION: Could I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble...
TRUMP: Where are you from?
QUESTION: BBC.
TRUMP: Here's another beauty.
QUESTION: That's a good line. Impartial, free and fair.
TRUMP: Yeah. Sure.
QUESTION: Mr. President...
TRUMP: Just like CNN right?
QUESTION: On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...
TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government...
QUESTION: Were there any mistakes...
TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait.
Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.
We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.
That's the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.
Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.
Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a one-month period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.
You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.
Kelly said you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.
Now nobody ever reports that. But that's why we did it quickly.
Now, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect. The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.
Now in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed.
QUESTION: Just a brief follow-up. But if it's so urgent, why not introduce...
TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead.
QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?
TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been.
QUESTION: During the election?
TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody...
QUESTION: So you're not aware of any contact during the course..
TRUMP: Look, look, look...
QUESTION: ... of the election?
TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question?
QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse.
I know you have to get up and ask a question. It's so important.
Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't. I just have nobody to speak to.
I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.
We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk.
I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.
Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.
QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?
TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he -- now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right?
He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who's a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.
QUESTION: Mr. President...
TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks?
QUESTION: Mr. President...
TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five?
QUESTION: Mr. President, on national...
TRUMP: Wait. Let's see. Who's -- I want to find a friendly reporter.
QUESTION: Mr....
TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead.
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)...
TRUMP: Go ahead.
QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven't seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being (OFF-MIKE).
Because (OFF-MIKE). However, what we've already heard about and what we (OFF-MIKE) is (OFF-MIKE) so you're general forecast (ph) like 48 (OFF-MIKE). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the (OFF-MIKE)...
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP:...he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not, its not, not -- not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question.
So here's the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti- Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican -- quiet, quiet, quiet.
See, he lied about -- he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive.
I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I've known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it.
So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.
QUESTION: Thank you, I'm Lisa (ph) from the...
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the PBS News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines?
TRUMP: Yeah.
QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific...
TRUMP: It's a very fair question.
QUESTION: ...countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration.
TRUMP: Right.
QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it?
TRUMP: We're gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.
In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they're gang members and they're drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way -- it's a very -- it's a very, very tough subject.
We're gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is -- is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.
But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.
I'm not talking about new laws, I'm talking the existing law, is very rough, it's very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.
But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.
And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK?
QUESTION: Mr. President...
(CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ...reopening of the White House Visitors Office?
TRUMP: Yes.
QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what's first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean...
TRUMP: Now, that's what I call a nice question. That is very -- who are you with?
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)
TRUMP: Good, I'm gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania's terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely.
And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania's gonna be outstanding, that's right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.
She, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issue, women's difficulties. Very, very strongly, she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country.
And a funny thing happens, because she gets -- she gets so unfairly -- Melania, the things they say. I've known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well.
She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say -- I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.
I'll just tell you this. I think she's going to be a fantastic first lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money.
They're not doing this for pay, they're doing this because they feel it; both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that's a very nice question.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump?
TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's OK.
QUESTION: It doesn't(ph) have(ph) to be a bad question.
TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.
QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you're --
TRUMP: Fix the inner cities.
QUESTION: -- president. Fixing the inner cities.
TRUMP: Yep.
QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that's coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn't bad, was it?
TRUMP: That was very professional and very good.
QUESTION: I'm very professional.
TRUMP: We'll be announcing the order in a little while and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.
I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.
And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know, it takes a long time.
It's taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we're going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we're going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.
You go to some of these inner city places and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people -- and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it -- in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.
They're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So, we're going to be very, very strong. That's a great question and -- and it's a -- it's a very difficult situation because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix.
We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know.
There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all -- and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.
I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK?
QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going -- are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your -- your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as --
TRUMP: Am I going to include who?
QUESTION: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional --
TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?
QUESTION: -- Hispanic Caucus --
TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting?
QUESTION: No -- no -- no. I'm not --
TRUMP: Are they friends of yours?
QUESTION: I'm just a reporter.
TRUMP: Well, then(ph) set up the meeting.
QUESTION: I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now.
TRUMP: Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can't move, it might be bad for me politically. I can't have that meeting.
I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.
QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.
TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can't make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told - he was probably told ""don't meet with Trump. It's bad politics.""
And that's part of the problem in this country. OK, one more.
QUESTION: (inaudible)
TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can't handle. This room can't handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.
QUESTION: (inaudible) ...not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible), some of it by supporters in your name. What do you...
TRUMP: ...And some of it - can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they're put up by the other side and you think it's like playing it straight?
No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead.
QUESTION: You're the president now. What are you going to do about it?
TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that?
QUESTION: What are you going to do about - what are you going to do about (inaudible).
TRUMP: Oh, I'm working on it. I'm working on it very - no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided - I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.
We're going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that's part of it. But we're going to work on education, we're going to work on - you know, we're going to stop - we're going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we're going to try and stop crime.
We're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime. But it's very important to me - but this isn't Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try - I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much.
It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks.",negative
486,"Washington (CNN) In response to a question Thursday about threats to Jewish centers nationwide, President Donald Trump called a Jewish reporter a liar, told him to sit down and later said anti-Semitism was coming from ""the other side.""
The exchange kicked off as Trump looked through the room at a White House news conference and asked for a question from a ""friendly reporter.""
He settled on a reporter who identified himself as Jake Turx, a reporter with Ami Magazine, which bills itself as ""a new standard in Jewish media."" Turx prefaced his question by saying he did not see evidence the President or his staff were anti-Semitic. He even mentioned Trump's Jewish grandchildren.
He then launched into the thrust of his question about bomb threats to dozens of Jewish Community Centers last month.
""What we are concerned about, and what we haven't really heard being addressed, is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it,"" Turx said.
As Turx continued, Trump interrupted, ""See, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question, and it's not.""
The reporter said, ""It's an important one.""
""Not a simple question. Not a fair question. OK, sit down. I understand the rest of your question,"" Trump said. ""So here's the story folks. No. 1, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. No. 2, racism. The least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.""
Turx raised his hand again and spoke up.
""Quiet, quiet, quiet,"" Trump replied. ""See he lied about -- he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question. So, you know, welcome to the world of the media.""
Turx shook his head, and Trump continued as if he himself had been accused of anti-Semitism, despite Turx's preface.
""But let me just tell you something: I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me -- and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Benjamin Netanyahu, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, 'I've known Donald Trump for a long time,' and then he said, 'Forget it.' So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.""
Later on in the news conference, Sirius XM's Jared Rizzi said, ""I'll follow up on my colleague's question about anti-Semitism. It's not about your personality or your beliefs. We're talking about a rise in anti-Semitism around the country. Some of it by supporters in your name. What can you do to deter that?""
Trump said, ""Some of it is written by our opponents. You do know that? Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that?""
He went on to insist anti-Semitism was coming from his political opponents, who were doing it to generate anger: ""Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or live Donald Trump. They're put up by the other side, and you think it's like playing it straight? No. But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.""
Turx followed up on Twitter, saying, ""President Trump clearly misunderstood my question. This is highly regretful and I'm going to seek clarification.""

Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and director of the Anti-Defamation League, blasted Trump's comments in an interview with CNN following the news conference and called on Trump to answer the questions about what he termed the ""crisis"" of rising anti-Semitic acts and take ""concrete steps"" to resolve the issue.
""In the face of danger, Trump dismisses critics, attacks journalists,"" Greenblatt said. ""These are not answers to a simple question: What is he going to do about the surge in anti-Semitism?""
In a statement, Interfaith Alliance President Rabbi Jack Moline called on Trump to protect the Jewish community, Muslim people and those of other minority faiths.
""President Trump's repeated avoidance of addressing the recent and substantial uptick in anti-Semitism in America can no longer be ignored,"" Moline said.

487,"Story highlights Trump said Flynn was simply ""doing his job"" by discussing issues like sanctions with Russia's ambassador
Trump learned about Flynn's conversation with the ambassador on January 26
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Thursday he didn't direct his former national security adviser Michael Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador -- but said he would have if he thought Flynn wasn't going to.
Trump repeatedly made clear during a news conference that he asked for Flynn's resignation because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about that conversation, not because he took issue with Flynn's discussing sanctions with a Russian ambassador.
That's because Trump said Flynn was simply ""doing his job"" by discussing issues like sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.
""Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So it certainly would've been OK with me if he did it,"" Trump said. ""I would've directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.""
Trump's comments about Flynn marked the first time the President has explained at length why he asked Flynn for his resignation earlier this week after just 24 days in the position as Trump's top foreign policy adviser.

Trump lost the popular vote by several million ballots to Hillary Clinton.
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump again overstated the size of his Electoral College win on Thursday, only to quickly fold and blame the claim on bad information.
Trump claimed at a news conference that he had the largest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. When told later in the news conference by NBC's Peter Alexander that information was false, Trump did not defend the argument, which he has made repeatedly in recent days, but said he was ""talking about Republicans.""
""I was given that information,"" Trump said, before quickly moving onto another questioner. ""Actually, I've seen that information around. It was a very substantial victory. Would you agree with that?""
Trump lost the popular vote by several million ballots to Hillary Clinton in November, but eclipsed the 270 electoral votes he needed to win.
Trump won enough states to give him 56.9% or 306 Electoral College votes. That places him 45th out of 58 US presidential campaigns in the ranking of winning percentages going all the way back to George Washington's victory in the election of 1789.

491,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's nominee to be the next US ambassador to Israel faced a grilling from senators a day after Trump backed off the long-held US and international position that the key to Middle East peace lies in a two-state solution.
That shift, which Trump revealed Wednesday at a White House news conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu, is just one reason the confirmation hearing for David Friedman, a New York bankruptcy lawyer, immediately veered into contentious territory. Protestors repeatedly interrupted the proceedings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and lawmakers assailed Friedman for previous comments they deemed insulting.
Friedman has backed Israeli settlements, which are seen as illegal under international law and as an impediment to a peace deal by Palestinians. He has called Palestinian statehood an ""illusion,"" raised millions of dollars for a settlement near the Palestinian city of Ramallah in the West Bank and he has excoriated critics in print, referring to a liberal Jewish group as ""kapos,"" the word for Jews who cooperated with Nazis during the Holocaust.
Lawmakers quizzed the ambassador-designate on his position on statehood in the wake of Trump's remarks. In answer to a question Wednesday, Trump said that he was ""looking at two-state and one-state and I like the one that both parties like.""
He added that, ""I can live with either one. I thought for a while that two-state looked like it might be the easier of the two, but ... if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I'm happy with the one they like the best.""
On Thursday, Trump's ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said of the administration that ""we absolutely support a two-state solution, but we are thinking out of the box as well, which is: What does it take to bring these two sides to the table?""
Over the course of Thursday's confirmation hearing, Friedman walked back many of his previous public statements, saying that the two-state solution ""remains I believe the best possibility for peace in the region"" and that settlements ""may not be helpful."" Any future Palestinian state would ideally be ""demilitarized,"" he said, Israel retaining control over the western border with Jordan.
And he pushed for a focus on Palestinian economic development instead, which many Palestinians see as a delaying tactic for coming to a peace deal.
Sen. Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, questioned Friedman's dismissal of the two-state solution as a ""damaging anachronism"" and told him his views ""constitute an unprecedented break"" from US policy.
Friedman answered that if the Israelis and Palestinians were able to reach an agreement ""through direct negotiations along parameters agreeable to them ... I would be delighted to see peace come to this region where people have suffered on both sides for so long.""
He continued, ""I have expressed my skepticism solely on the basis of my perception of the Palestinians' failure to renounce terror and accept Israel as a Jewish state.""
In a February 2016 article in an Israeli newspaper, Friedman described the idea of a two-state solution as a ""scam.""
Friedman went on to mentioned the 1993 Oslo Accords' requirement that Palestinian leaders end incitement against Israel: ""We haven't made progress since then. In the aftermath of Oslo, terrorism has increased four-fold.""
He made no mention of Israeli actions such as settlement construction, the destruction of Palestinian homes and seizure of Palestinian land in the West Bank as possible obstructions to a peace agreement or drivers of violence.
And he said that if there are attempts to move forward on Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, it should happen behind closed doors.
""I happen to believe that with respect to the state of Israel, discretion is incredibly important and public comments can be defeating,"" Friedman said. ""If there's progress to be made in the Middle East and the peace process, it's through private diplomacy ... behind the scenes.""
At one point, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida asked whether Friedman thought Palestinians were the major obstacle to peace; whether he disagreed with the ""orthodoxy"" that the US needs to be an honest broker between Israel and the Palestinians; and whether he felt ""professionals in the State Department and the foreign policy elite"" unfairly maligned Israel.
""Yes,"" Friedman replied.
New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, noted that Friedman is ""very passionate about Israel,"" and then asked Friedman to assure the committee that his loyalty and commitment lay with the US. Friedman agreed that it does.
But much of the hearing was taken up with rhetoric rather than policy.
As Friedman began his opening remarks, a series of protesters stood to denounce him, interrupting him at regular intervals.
""We will not be silent, you do not represent us and you will never represent us,"" shouted one young man wearing a kippah, the Jewish head covering.
A young man waving a Palestinian flag shouted that in the West Bank, ""Palestinians are there and will always be there.""
Even before Friedman began speaking, his representatives tried to defuse anger about some of the insults he has previously leveled at President Barack Obama and members of Congress.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, introduced Friedman to the panel, saying the ""deal-making bankruptcy lawyer"" is ""very passionate, he has said some things I don't agree with, but ... what's encouraging to me is he's said, 'Maybe I should watch my rhetoric.' ""
New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall detailed many of the insults Friedman had hurled in print before being selected for the ambassadorial role.
""He has insulted and denigrated members of the Senate,"" Udall said. He quoted Friedman's comment about senior Democratic New York Sen. Charles Schumer, after Democratic colleagues voted to approve the Iran nuclear deal, that ""Schumer is validating the worst appeasement of terrorism since Munich,"" where Palestinian terrorists killed Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games.
Udall also said that Friedman had ""slandered"" President Barack Obama when he described ""the blatant anti-Semitism emanating from our president and his sycophantic minions.""
And he pointed out that Friedman once said of the Anti-Defamation League that ""frankly, they sound like morons.""
The ADL released a statement Thursday saying that Friedman had expressed regret for his words. ""We accept his apology and appreciate his outreach,"" the ADL said. Friedman will ""represent all segments of the Jewish community and the broader country.""
Democratic senators, however, told Friedman that his use of rhetoric raised questions about whether he was suited for the job and whether he would represent all Americans.
""The language you have regularly used against those who disagree with your views has me concerned about your preparedness to enter the world of diplomacy,"" Cardin said.
Sen. Christopher Coons, a Delaware Democrat, put it unusually bluntly: ""Your comments have been ""intemperate inappropriate and insulting.""
Friedman didn't try to defend himself, telling Cardin at one point that ""there is no excuse. If you want me to rationalize or justify it, I can not. I regret"" using those words.
But he also made clear he was apologizing only for his word choices, not for his positions. ""I have profound differences of opinion with the J Street Organization,"" the group he compared to Nazi collaborators. ""My regrets are as to the language and the rhetoric,"" he said. ""I'm not withdrawing my personal views as to the organization.""
Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, pressed Friedman about Trump's announcement that he would move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a highly sensitive issue traditionally left for final status negotiations as both Israelis and Palestinians claim the city as their capital.
That announcement was originally folded into Trump's statement that the New York lawyer was his pick for ambassador to Israel. The President has since walked it back, saying Wednesday that, ""I'd love to see that happen. We're looking at it very, very strongly. We're looking at it with great care, great care, believe me, and we'll see what happens.""
""There will be ramifications if we move"" the embassy, Paul told Friedman, and went on to ask if he was ""a thoughtful individual"" who would think through the implications of a move with the President. ""Will it be worth our while,"" he said.
""The decision obviously will be made by the President and I will support him considering the political, security and other ramifications of it,"" Friedman said.",negative

493,"Washington (CNN) Justice Department attorney Michelle Bennett learned firsthand Monday what it feels like to have a tweet written by the President of the United States used against her in federal court.
Bennett was asking district court Judge James Robart to temporarily postpone proceedings concerning the President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration while a federal appeals court was still considering the issue.
In response, Robart brought up Trump's tweet sent after the appeals court ruled against the White House last week. ""SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!"" Trump tweeted in all caps.
""Counsel, I'm a little surprised,"" Robart told Bennett as she made her request for postponement, ""since the President said he wanted to 'see you in Court'....Are you confident that's the argument you want to make?""
""Yes, your honor"" Bennett said. Robart ultimately ruled against her.
To be sure, Robart's comment was lighthearted, but it reflects the facts that judges are not immune to a series of tweets the President has launched about the case, often criticizing the judiciary and particular judges. Courts are also looking at other statements Trump has made that could directly impact the defense of his travel ban. Indeed, less than four weeks into his administration Trump's outbursts might serve not only to complicate the arguments made by government lawyers but also jeopardize the future of his executive order on immigration.
A key part of the argument against the travel ban, for instance, is that it discriminates on the basis of religion. It is something the government lawyers have flatly rejected, but the courts -- so far -- are taking seriously.
""To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,"" Trump wrote in a statement last month. ""This is not about religion—this is about terror and keeping our country safe,"" he said.
But in almost every brief filed, the challengers have carefully detailed the comments Trump made during the campaign and afterwards that they argue prove that there was an intent to discriminate.
And the argument seems to be resonating with some judges -- although the challenge is still at a preliminary stage.
Trump's executive order bars citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
During one hearing when Washington State Solicitor General Noah Purcell was asked about whether the ban inferred ""religious animus,"" Purcell pounced.
""The case law from this court and the Supreme Court is very clear that to prove religious discrimination, we do not need to prove that this order harms only Muslims, or that it harms every Muslim. We just need to prove that it was motivated in part by a desire to harm Muslims,"" he said.
He went on to tell the court that although the states haven't had any discovery, they have come across ""rather shocking evidence of intent to discriminate"" including public statements from the President.
Purcell outlined examples in court briefs of Trump's statements including one he made when he was a candidate on December 7, 2015 when he issued a press release calling for a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.""
When the 9th Circuit panel eventually ruled in favor of Purcell, it did so on due process grounds but the judges mentioned the religious claims and wrote: ""It is well established that evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims.""
""There is no question that President Trump's order is not an explicit ban on all Muslims,"" said Kari E. Hong a professor at Boston College Law School who has signed a brief in support of the states challenging the ban: Washington and Minnesota.
""But the courts have long recognized that government officials with prejudice often are savvy enough to hide their intent behind words that seem neutral,"" she said. ""That is why statements that President Trump and his top advisors made in public, to one another, and even in tweets, will be central to determining what in fact was the purpose of the ban.""
In a different case on Monday night, Judge Leonie Brinkema, of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia noted that the Commonwealth has produced ""unrebutted evidence"" supporting its position that it is likely to succeed on its claim that the ban was a violation of the Establishment Clause.
""The 'Muslim ban' was a center piece of the president's campaign for months, and the press release calling for it was still available on his website as of the day this Memorandum Opinion is being entered,"" she wrote.
In a new lawsuit filed in Maryland the National Immigration Law Center argues that the executive order was ""intended and designed to target and discriminate against Muslims."" The lawyers maintain ""rarely in American history has governmental intent to discriminate against a particular faith and its adherents been so plain.""
They point to a July 2016 interview on NBC's Meet the Press. ""Candidate Trump was asked if a plan similar to the now-enacted Executive Order was a 'roll back' from the 'Muslim ban,"" the lawyers wrote.
""Candidate Trump responded: 'I don't think so. I actually don't think it's a rollback. In fact, you could say it's an expansion. I'm looking now at territories,'"" they wrote.
""Candidate Trump continued, 'People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Oh, you can't use the word Muslim. Remember this. And I'm okay with that, because I'm talking territory instead of Muslim.'""
They also provided comments that former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Trump supporter, made on Fox News last month. ""When [candidate Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban."" He called me up. He said, ""put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.""
Not all judges reference Trump's statements, however, US District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, ruled in favor of Trump and declined to extend a temporary restraining order. Of the Establishment Clause claims he said simply, that at least in one section of the Executive Order is ""neutral with respect to religion.""
And Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, believes ""it is highly questionable that courts can or will consider evidence of any kind about the motivations behind the President's actions."" He cites federal law that provides that the President can 'suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants' and said, ""that does not empower courts to second-guess his reasons.""
McConnell also argues that ""A candidate is not the government. Candidate Trump advocated a Muslim ban, but the executive order is not a Muslim Ban. Is the government of the United States precluded from taking what would otherwise be legitimate steps to screen out applicants from nations where it is difficult to vet their applications, because a candidate said something outrageous on the campaign trail?""",negative
494,"(CNN) The first weeks of a US presidency are usually filled with optimism -- a fresh face with a clean slate settles into the White House and maps out a vision for the next four years.
But this period for President Donald Trump has been a rocky one, dominated by mounting Russia problems.
A scandal over communications between key Trump aides and Russian officials ahead of the President's inauguration widened yet again on Friday as it emerged that Trump's senior aide and son-in-law Jared Kushner had met with Russia's ambassador to Washington , Sergey Kislyak, at a time when the Trump administration's relationship with Russia was under close scrutiny.
On Wednesday evening it emerged that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had also met with Kislyak twice during the campaign period, even though he told Congress upon his confirmation that he did not communicate with any Russian officials.
It is a case of deja vu for Trump -- just two weeks earlier his top national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about a conversation with the same diplomat, Kislyak.
Here's a rundown of the latest Russia issues dogging the Trump administration.
THE AMBASSADOR
JUST WATCHED What to know about Sergey Kislyak Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What to know about Sergey Kislyak 01:14
Kislyak is proving poisonous for the Trump administration -- two senior officials appointed by the President were found to have spoken with the ambassador before the administration's first day on the job, and then failed to disclose those talks when asked about communications with Russia.
Kislyak is considered by US intelligence to be one of Russia's top spies and spy-recruiters in Washington, according to current and former senior US government officials. Russian officials dispute this characterization.
In a conference call with journalists Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said: ""Nobody has heard a single statement from US intelligence agencies' representatives regarding our ambassador. Again, these are some depersonalized assumptions of the media that are constantly trying to blow this situation out of proportion.""
But a Justice Department official later confirmed that Sessions had met with Kislyak twice -- in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention and in September in his office when he was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Sessions responded to the allegations swiftly on Wednesday, saying he had ""never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign,"" and describing the allegations as ""false.""
Sessions's spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, said there was nothing ""misleading about his answer"" as he was not asked specifically about ""meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.""
Sessions was forced to recuse himself from overseeing any investigation involving the Trump election campaign.

And on Friday, a senior administration official told CNN that Kushner and Flynn had met with Kislyak at Trump Tower in December for an ""introductory meeting."" The meeting lasted for about 10 minutes, the official added.
Kushner's involvement in a meeting was first reported by The New Yorker, and Flynn's by The New York Times.
The official disputed the idea that accepting a meeting with the Russian ambassador could be cause for concern in light of the discussion about Russian meddling in the US election, characterizing the meeting as merely an attempt to meet key international players during the transition to power. The official added that Kushner met with dozens of other ambassadors.
Flynn had resigned amid revelations that he misled the then Vice President-elect Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak.
The Washington Post first reported phone calls made in December before Trump took office, including some on the same day that the Obama administration placed fresh sanctions on Russia over the alleged election meddling.
Law enforcement and intelligence officials also told CNN that the calls were made that day -- he had told Pence in a briefing that he had not been in communication with Russian officials, the White House says.
He admitted to briefing Pence ""with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador"" and was forced to resign on February 13 after just 23 days on the job.
A US official confirmed to CNN that Flynn and Kislyak spoke about fresh sanctions placed on Russia by the Obama administration.

An ongoing investigation into Russia's activities in the US -- following the country's alleged interference in the 2016 US election -- has opened up a Pandora's box for the Trump administration.
Flynn's resignation came after reports emerged that the Justice Department had told the White House about Flynn's phone calls with the ambassador.
Just two days later, law enforcement, administration and intelligence officials told CNN that high-level advisers close to Trump were in constant communication with Russians known to US intelligence during the election campaign.
They named Flynn as well as then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who denies the accusations.
""That is 100% not true, at least as far as me,"" Manafort said.
""I cannot believe that they are including me in anything like that. I have not been involved in any of these activities.""
Flynn did not respond to CNN's request for comment regarding the report.
The frequency of their communications during early summer ""raised a red flag"" with US intelligence and law enforcement, according to the officials CNN spoke with.
The communications were intercepted during routine intelligence collection targeting Russian officials and other Russian nationals known to US agencies.

Trump dismissed the claims in a tweet, saying the ""Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.""
The President has complained of the leaks coming out of intelligence agencies, branding them as a threat to security and calling the media stories that followed ""fake news.""

Just over a week before Trump was sworn in, CNN reported that Trump and then-President Barack Obama were briefed on the existence of a dossier making damning but unsubstantiated allegations , including that Russian operatives had compromising information on Trump.
In February, US investigators said they had corroborated some details in the 35-page document, compiled by a former British intelligence agent, through intercepted communications, giving some weight to the veracity of at least parts of the document as other allegations are investigated.
Investigators did not confirm some of the more salacious allegations, but did detail around a dozen conversations between senior Russian officials and other Russian individuals mentioned in the document, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings told CNN.
The two-page synopsis originally presented to Trump and Obama included allegations of a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government, according to two national security officials.

THE MISSILE

Both Trump's team and Russian officials had called for better relations between the old Cold War adversaries, and Trump and Putin openly exchanged compliments during the campaign.
Despite the Kremlin's calls for warmer relations, Russia has made a string of provocative moves since Trump took office. On February 14, a senior military official told CNN that Russia had deployed a cruise missile in an apparent treaty violation.
The Kremlin denied that it had violated the treaty.
Moscow has also positioned a spy ship off the coast of Delaware and carried out flights near a US Navy warship, concerning American officials. The US administration has not officially drawn any links between the three events.
The ground-launched cruise missile seems to run counter to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the military official said. The New York Times first reported is deployment.

While declining to speak on intelligence matters, a spokesman for the US State Department said that Russia was in violation of the treaty.
Acting spokesman Mark Toner said that Russia was obliged ""not to possess, produce or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 to 5,500 kilometers, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.""
He said the White House had ""made very clear our concerns about Russia's violation.""
Russia is believed to have tested one such missile in 2014.
On February 10, a US Navy warship in the Black Sea had three encounters with Russian aircraft Friday that were deemed to be unsafe and unprofessional because of how close the Russian planes flew to the US, according to a senior defense official.
Moscow pushed back on the allegation , with Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov telling state media there had been no such incident.

The Trump administration and the Kremlin have already found themselves in back-and-forth commentary over Russia's annexation of Crimea.
As scrutiny over the Trump administration's ties to Russia grows, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump had on the contrary been ""incredibly tough on Russia.""
""He continues to raise the issue of Crimea, which the previous administration had allowed to be seized by Russia. His ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, stood before the UN Security Council on her first day and strongly denounced the Russian occupation of Crimea,"" he told reporters at a press briefing.
He said that Trump had made it clear he expected the Russian government to ""deescalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea,"" while at the same time pursuing better relations with Russia.

Trump had previously buoyed the Kremlin's claim on Crimea.
The Kremlin shot back at Spicer's comments. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia was ""not returning our territory. Crimea is part of the Russian Federation.""

495,"Jerusalem (CNN) ""Tomorrow's world will be different -- and it is very near.""
Those were the words of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he dismissed last month's Mideast peace conference in Paris as ""useless,"" instead focusing on the inauguration of US President Donald Trump just days later.
This new world, one both Trump and Netanyahu hope to create from what they see as the ruins of the previous presidency, will include not only the future relationship between Israel and the United States but the renewal of ties after eight years of perceived mutual loathing under President Barack Obama.
By the time the Obama administration vacated the White House, just weeks after the United States broke with precedent by not vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel's settlement activity , the relationship had gone from cold to positively arctic.
Netanyahu, enraged by the move, has made no secret of his dislike for Obama while championing the arrival of Trump.
""We have known each other for years, but this will be his first meeting since being elected as President of the United States and mine as Prime Minister of Israel,"" Netanyahu said at this week's Cabinet meeting.
The Iran deal, the peace process and the constant speculation over moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem are all likely to be on the agenda.
Here's how the two men shape up on the big talking points ahead of Wednesday's meeting.
Iran
Netanyahu's view:
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- or Iran Deal -- was inked in 2015. According to officials, the agreement extends the time it would take for Tehran to develop a nuclear weapon from two months to more than a year.
The five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany agreed to the deal that saw sanctions eased on Iran in return.
Netanyahu lobbied hard against the deal that sought to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, saying the agreement would only pave ""Iran's path to the bomb."" He presented his case before the UN General Assembly and went behind President Barack Obama's back to present it to the United States Congress.
But as he has made clear on a number of occasions, Netanyahu sees Iran as an existential threat, hell bent on the destruction of Israel.
Trump's view:
Netanyahu believes he has found an ally in Trump, who has been an outspoken critic of the Iran Deal, calling it ""one of the worst deals ever.""
The new US President has already slapped sanctions on Tehran for a ballistic missile test but neither he nor Netanyahu have offered a clear alternative to the deal.
Members of Trump's administration also have urged caution on scrapping the deal. During his confirmation hearings, Defense Secretary James Mattis said: ""When America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.""
Trump faces a conundrum whereby European allies want the deal to remain in place, while Israel wants a harder line.
Settlements
Netanyahu's view:
One issue on which Israel virtually stands alone is settlements -- the Israeli cities, towns and communities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
""On the issue of settlements, no one takes more care than me and the Likud government,"" the Prime Minister said at his weekly Cabinet meeting on January 22.
""We will continue to take care of (the settlements) with wisdom and responsibility for the benefit of the settlements and the state of Israel.""
Six thousand new settler homes as well as a brand new settlement have been announced by Israel in the last four weeks.
The international community condemns settlements as illegal, which Israel disputes. Previous US presidents have described settlements as an ""obstacle to peace.""
Last December, the UN Security Council issued its strongest condemnation to date, saying settlements have ""no legal validity"" and ""constitute a flagrant violation of international law."" The US, which has veto power, abstained from the vote.
Following the decision, Israel accused the US and the Obama administration of betrayal.
Trump's view:
In Trump, Israel hopes it will find a slightly more sympathetic ear.
But in the last fortnight, the Trump administration has begun to make noises suggesting it wants Israel to put the brakes on settlement activity, calling recent expansion announcements ""not helpful.""
In a recent interview with the Israel Hayom newspaper, Trump described himself as ""not somebody that believes that going forward with ... settlements is a good thing for peace.""
But the pro-settler movement in Israel remains buoyant. Israel's Knesset just passed a law, known as the Regulation Law, which serves to legalize many dozens of settler outposts built on private Palestinian land.
The law is now expected to be contested in Israel's Supreme Court.
Peace process
Netanyahu's view:
The bedrock of the peace process, as understood by the international community, is the two-state solution.
Successive US presidents, both Republican and Democratic, have supported this goal.
Equally, both Israelis and Palestinians have expressed their commitment to two states living side by side.
""In my vision of peace, there are two free peoples living side by side in this small land, with good neighborly relations and mutual respect, each with its flag, anthem and government, with neither one threatening its neighbor's security and existence,"" said Netanyahu at Bar Ilan University in 2009.
Fast-forward to 2017 and many in the international community wonder whether Netanyahu's actions on settlements mean he has any intention to stick to that position.
But Israel's Prime Minister rejects such criticism. He says blame for the failure to move the peace process forward lies with the Palestinians and their refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.
Trump's view:
Trump has called a successful resolution of the peace process ""the ultimate deal."" But it's eluded US presidents since the founding of the state of Israel almost 70 years ago.
He says he wants his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to lead his diplomatic efforts in the region. But Kushner is untested in foreign policy and a largely unknown quantity in the Middle East.
Any efforts to broker peace will come up against entrenched positions.
Israel's far right now talks openly about annexing the West Bank, a threat which Palestinians are taking seriously.
In response to the passing of the Regulation Law on settler outposts, Saeb Erekat, the Secretary General of PLO's Executive Committee said: ""All Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine are illegal and a war crime regardless of any law passed by the Israeli Parliament or any decision taken by any Israeli judge. The Israeli settlement enterprise negates peace and the possibility of the two-state solution.""
US Embassy
Netanyahu's view:
It was only last month while speaking to his Cabinet that Netanyahu made the clearest declaration yet on the embassy question telling ministers: ""Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, and it is proper that not only should the American Embassy be here, but all embassies should come here.""
If the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem, it would be seen as effectively recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Such a move would overturn 70 years of international consensus, that Jerusalem's status should be settled in a final peace agreement, and, some argue, would effectively signal the end of moves to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
As far as the international community is concerned, East Jerusalem is the capital of a future Palestinian state.
Trump's view:
During his campaign, Trump pledged to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but he appears to be tapping the brakes.
He hinted that the prospect of moving the embassy's location would be part of a great peace deal but gave little specifics in an interview published by Israel Hayom on February 10. This is more in line with previous White House administrations, which have all exercised the presidential waiver over the 1995 Act of Congress which calls for the embassy to be moved.
""The embassy is not an easy decision. It has obviously been out there for many, many years, and nobody has wanted to make that decision,"" said Trump. ""I'm thinking about it very seriously, and we will see what happens.""
Significantly, in addition to being popular among many Israelis, Trump is also riding a wave of popularity among many Arab leaders, who felt neglected by the Obama administration.
These countries are urging Trump not to make a unilateral decision , fearing unrest on the streets throughout the Middle East.
Also important is the fact that Israel and a number of its Arab neighbors have enjoyed a warming of relations in recent years, built around a common enemy, Iran. This backroom diplomacy would likely take a hit if the US Embassy changed its address.
Syria
Netanyahu's view:
Israel has been keeping a close eye on Syria's six-year civil war from across the border in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights -- which the international community considers to be occupied territory.
""I don't know if we can resolve (the Syria civil war) but we can help mitigate some of the suffering. That's the best that Israel can do. Of course we don't let the Syrian war or aggression from Syria spill over into our territory you know our position, my red lines -- we keep them stringently,"" Netanayuhu explained in December.
Occasional spill over from the war has been met with force by Israel's army.
But Israel's real concern isn't the occasional rogue shell, it's what the resurgence in the fortunes of President Bashar al-Assad might mean for arguably one of Israel's most dangerous foes.
""Hezbollah is a main threat for the state of Israel. They are tied up in Syria today but they have not put down those arms that are pointing towards Israel,"" says Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner.
In return for supporting an ally, Israeli officials say, Syria is smuggling advanced weapons to Hezbollah. Several times in recent months, Syrian state media has reported alleged Israeli airstrikes near Damascus. They're believed to be targeting arms bound for Lebanon. Israel never comments.
Trump's view:
Trump has yet to set out any clear policy on what he wants to achieve in Syria in terms of ending the violence.
He has been praised by President Assad, who believes Trump could become an ally and help in the fight against ISIS.
In terms of refugees, last month Trump stated he will ""absolutely do safe zones in Syria,"" for refugees fleeing the violence.
But his travel ban , against seven Muslim-majority countries, including Syria, has caused huge controversy both at home and abroad.
During his first televised interview as President, Trump said that Germany and other European countries had made mistakes by allowing millions of refugees across their borders.
""I don't want that to happen here,"" he told ABC News.",negative
496,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump rejected the long-established US framework for Middle East peacemaking at a White House visit with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday as he announced his desire to reach ""the ultimate deal.""
In staking his claim to a prize that has eluded many a leader before him, Trump previewed the nascent outlines of an approach that -- if he sticks with it -- ditches bipartisan orthodoxy, borrows some old ideas and, Middle East experts say, will be no easier to pull off now than in the past.
As Trump declared his deep support for the Jewish state, he abandoned the bedrock principle that the solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will come via two states for two peoples. Instead, he referred to the possibility of an Arab-backed peace process, an idea that's been floating around since the beginning of this century without producing results.
""The United States will encourage a peace and really, a great peace deal,"" Trump declared at a news conference alongside Netanyahu. ""We'll be working on it very, very diligently.""
Asked whether he was abandoning the idea of a two-state solution, Trump said, ""I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like.""
He continued, ""If Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I'm happy with the one they like the best.""
He also said at one point, ""It is the parties themselves that must directly negotiate. Both sides will have to make compromises."" Then turning to Netanyahu, he added a question: ""You know that, right?""
UN Sec Gen: 'No plan B'
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking in Cairo alongside the Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs, stressed that the Israelis and Palestinians must not abandon a commitment to a two-state solution.
""There is no Plan B to the situation between Palestinians and Israelis but a two-state solution and that everything must be done to preserve that possibility,"" he said in remarks to the press.
The night before Netanyahu's arrival at the White House, senior administration officials cast doubt on the two-state solution, which the international community still holds as the basic foundation of any agreement. The US explicitly called for that arrangement under Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama.
The Trump official's comments drew a response from PLO Executive Committee Member Hanan Ashrawi, who said that if Trump was ""trying to create alternative realities, then he should spell out what the options are. A one-state solution would require equal rights and citizenship for all, unless he is advocating an apartheid state.""
There are growing questions about whether a two-state solution is even possible, given Israel's continued settlement building, said Diana Buttu, a former spokeswoman for the Palestinian Liberation Organization who now teaches at Harvard University.
Since Trump's inauguration, Israel has announced 6,000 new settlement homes and legalized settler outposts in the West Bank.
""They've done that for 20 years, say they want a two-state solution, build settlements and destroy Palestinian homes,"" Buttu said. ""That's not the behavior of someone who wants peace.""
As a result, young Palestinians are ""increasingly talking very openly about a struggle for one person, one vote,"" Buttu said.
Many Israelis, on the other hand, say that the Palestinians haven't warmly embraced a two-state solution either, pointing to polls showing that the idea has dropping support among the Palestinian public and arguing that its leaders haven't been willing to participate in the direct talks needed to reach an agreement.
Netanyahu, who endorsed the idea of two states in 2009 under pressure from the Obama administration, sidestepped questions about whether he still supports the concept Wednesday, saying instead he wanted to avoid ""labels"" and talk substance: the need for Palestinians to recognize Israel as a Jewish state and the need for Israel to have overriding security control. It's not clear how Netanyahu is going to persuade them to come to the table.
He also didn't give a direct response when asked whether he would comply with Trump's request at the news conference that he ""hold back"" on settlement expansion.
Pressed by reporters later Wednesday, the Israeli Prime Minister replied, ""I think we'll try to find a common understanding that is consistent with pursuit of peace and security.""
It was an early indication that getting the parties to comply with US aspirations in the Middle East can be a challenge.
Natan Sachs, a fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, said that for Netanyahu, the point isn't so much ""to get to the deal with Palestinians, but to change the parameters and include the Arab states. That would be good for Israel if there is a deal with Palestinians, and it would be good for Israel if there isn't a deal.""
States aligned with Israel in their dislike of Iran include Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Israel has forged close but quiet security ties with these Sunni-majority nations over that shared view of Tehran. Now, Netanyahu is hoping to make those relationships more open and win Arab recognition of Israel by drawing these countries into negotiations on Mideast peace.
""I believe the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach,"" Netanyahu said at the White House, ""from involving our newfound Arab partners in the pursuit of a broader peace and peace with the Palestinians.""
JUST WATCHED Netanyahu: No greater supporter than Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Netanyahu: No greater supporter than Trump 02:44
Trump described the idea of Arab involvement as ""actually a much bigger deal, a much more important deal in a sense. It would take in many, many countries and it would cover a very large territory.""
Trump has said his chief negotiator for Middle East peace will be his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has already been meeting with influential Arab leaders, such as Jordan's King Abdullah and UAE ambassador to the US Yousef al-Otaiba.
""I think we have some pretty good cooperation from people in the past who would never, ever have even thought about doing this,"" Trump said, ""so we'll see how that works.""
Sachs said that Trump seems to think the regional approach is new.
""It's not,"" he said, pointing to a 2001 Saudi initiative that proposed Arab recognition of Israel in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria and an independent Palestinian state whose capital was East Jerusalem.
It was adopted by the Arab League in 2002 and re-endorsed in 2007 but has yet to lead to a resolution to the conflict.
While Jordan and Egypt have formal peace deals with Israel, Gulf states don't have formal diplomatic relations with Jerusalem and would have to sell a deal to their citizens before publicly improving ties.
""They've got to be able to sell their closeness to Israel to their own domestic politics as, among many other good things, something that's helpful to the Palestinians,"" said Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute. ""The idea that Israel wouldn't have to do much on the Palestinians and have major progress with the Gulf states, that's a misread of the political dynamics.""",negative

Senate Republicans say they are confident in the investigation under way
Washington (CNN) Senate Democrats on Wednesday sought to ride the latest revelations of coordination between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russian officials while Senate Republicans -- even some of the most hawkish on Russia -- sought to hold the line against new investigations.

501,"(CNN) Over the past 72 hours, reporters from a number of outlets -- including CNN -- have turned up new information on the Trump team's alleged conversations with Russians known to US intelligence.
President Donald Trump asked for the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, on Monday night, amid new reports that Flynn had repeatedly discussed sanctions with Russian officials before Trump took office. But for every new detail, two new questions spring up. And a broader pattern of potential ethics issues becomes more difficult to ignore.
During a press conference Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump answered questions from reporters for the Christian Broadcasting Network (he said Flynn was a good man mistreated by the media) and the conservative website Townhall.com (he threw out years of US foreign policy doctrine regarding a two-state solution in the Middle East ) — but he refused to acknowledge inquiries about reported contacts between his senior advisers and suspected Russian operatives.
Here are 21 questions on Russia, Flynn, and investigations now facing the White House. Some have been hinted or nudged at during press briefings, and others have been asked and answered -- but in confusing or unsatisfying ways.
1. Did any top aides make repeated contact, as reported by CNN, with senior Russian officials before the November election?2. If yes, what was discussed?
3. After the election, but before becoming president, did you or any of your top aides instruct Michael Flynn to contact the Russian ambassador?

502,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made their debut Wednesday as chummy partners preparing to tackle the Middle East's toughest challenges side by side.
Netanyahu beamed at his new American counterpart and declared him the best friend Israel could possibly wish for, while Trump offered lofty praise for Israel, denounced the Iranian nuclear deal and declined to back a two-state solution -- a longstanding, bipartisan US policy that the Israeli Prime Minister has questioned.
The encounter signaled a warmer chapter in US-Israel relations than Netanyahu had enjoyed with Trump's predecessor. After eight years of grappling with President Barack Obama, Netanyahu embraced a like-minded counterpart at the White House.
But Trump also made clear that he would not give Israel carte blanche, taking a harder line on some issues than he had during the campaign.
""I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit,"" Trump told his counterpart, the most direct indication from the Trump administration of its stance on the controversial issue.
Trump delivered the message as a polite request rather than an official warning but still represented a public demand from a White House that had previously been more open to settlement building that other US administrations. During Trump's campaign, he encouraged Israel to ""keep going"" with settlement construction.
Trump also stepped back from other components of his campaign's rhetoric endorsing Israel's positions on several sensitive issues.
He said Wednesday he'd ""love"" to see the US Embassy move to Jerusalem but offered no indication it would happen in the near future, as he had promised before he stepped into office. And he made no mention of his campaign pledge to recognize Jerusalem as the ""undivided"" capital of Israel, another campaign promise.
While Trump offered some insight into how his administration will tackle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he avoided drilling down on specifics.
He did not specify whether his request that Netanyahu ""hold back on settlements"" applied only to the construction of new settlements, or the expansion of existing ones -- and whether it applied to those in East Jerusalem.
Trump struck an optimistic tone as he announced his intention to broker a lasting peace to end the decades-old conflict that has stumped his predecessors.
""The United States will encourage a peace, and really a great peace deal. We'll be working on it very diligently -- very important to me also,"" Trump said. ""But it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement.""
He declined to offer any specific positions, however, instead backing away from the major tenet that has guided recent administration in how to resolve the conflict: a two-state solution, one for Israelis and one for Palestinians.
""I'm looking at two state and one state, and I like the one that both parties like,"" Trump said. ""If Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I'm happy with the one they like the best.""
Trump then called on Israel to ""show some flexibility"" in striking a deal and said Palestinians ""have to get rid of some of the hatred they're taught at a very young age."" Trump also signaled that Arab countries would be invited to help with negotiations to ""make it easier"" to achieve a peace deal.
""I also believe that we're going to have other players at a very high level and I think it might make it easier on Palestinians and others,"" he said.
Netanyahu, for his part, sought opportunities to draw closer to his new American counterpart.
He praised Trump for his strong stance against Islamic extremism, saying, ""Under your leadership, I believe we can reverse the rising tide of radical Islam.""
Trump also hit themes of importance to Israel concerning the wider region. He repeated a frequent criticism of the deal between Tehran and six world powers worked out under the Obama administration, which Trump called ""one of the worst deals I've ever seen.""
""I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing -- I mean ever developing -- a nuclear weapon,"" Trump said, referring to recent sanctions slapped on the country for a missile launch.
And Trump vowed that the US would guard Israel from any negative action at the United Nations, which Trump said has treated Israel ""very, very unfairly."" In one of its last actions, the Obama administration refrained from vetoing a resolution at the UN Security Council condemning Israel for its settlement expansion.

Asked by an Israeli reporter about the rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the US since his election and any connection to the support his campaign received from bigoted groups, Trump first touted his electoral victory before pledging he will ""do everything in our power to stop long-simmering racism and other things going on.""
The Anti-Defamation League slammed the response, tweeting: ""Troubling that @POTUS failed to condemn real issue of anti-Semitism in US today.""

503,"(CNN) Just before noon, first lady Melania Trump emerged from the White House's South entrance and walked beside her husband, President Donald Trump, to await the arrival of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara.
While the setup -- a President and first lady greeting a national leader -- has been witnessed hundreds of times throughout history, Wednesday marked a first for Melania Trump officially hosting at the White House.
She has interacted with Sara Netanyahu before, as recently as November, when the Prime Minister posted on his Facebook page details of a call between his wife and the then-first lady-elect.
Wednesday's appearance by Melania Trump, and her attendance in the front row of the joint news conference in the East Room between the two leaders, is further evidence of the first lady's Washington coming out.
Although she primarily maintains residence in the Trump's gilded Manhattan penthouse -- and will do so until 10-year-old Barron completes the school year in New York City -- her presence Wednesday is evidence she might indeed take a more active role in official duties.
Following the news conference, she hosted Sara Netanyahu on a visit to the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture.
""As we remember, with deep humility and reverence, the historic plight of slavery which the Jewish and African-American people have known all too well, we rededicate ourselves to those powerful words that both our nations hold dear: ""NEVER AGAIN!"" Melania Trump said in a statement to CNN.
The stop at the museum was reminiscent of this past weekend in Palm Beach, where the first lady spent time with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's wife, Akie Abe, showing her around nearby gardens, and sitting beside her at two Mar-a-Lago dinners.
Thank you @morikamimuseum for the inspirational presentation of your sacred gardens & life & culture in Japan. pic.twitter.com/JxfwaPjX06 — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) February 11, 2017
But the so-called Winter White House isn't the Washington White House, where the first lady's headquarters, and staff, have traditionally operated. Melania Trump is slowly bringing on a team there, recently announcing the hires of chief of staff Lindsay Reynolds, and social secretary Rickie Niceta Lloyd, and continuing under the guidance of her chief adviser, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who was also present at the news conference.
Further evidence of the burgeoning FLOTUS operation was a statement released by the first lady announcing the reopening of the White House Visitors Office and the resumption of public tours on March 7.
Later in the evening on Wednesday, the first lady will have another opportunity to showcase her hostess skills: She and the President will dine in the White House Blue Room with Sen. Marco Rubio and his wife, Jeanette.",neutral

505,"Story highlights ""There needs to be an independent, thorough review,"" Fallon said
""Donald Trump won. Period. Full stop,"" he added
Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton's former campaign aides are apoplectic about revelations that top advisers close to now-President Donald Trump's campaign were in constant communication with Russians known to US intelligence during the 2016 contest.
Now, they are weighing how to hold Trump's feet to the fire without making it look like they are questioning the legitimacy of his 2016 win.
""There needs to be an independent, thorough review to get to the bottom of Trump's connections with Russia,"" Brian Fallon, Clinton's former press secretary, told CNN in an interview. ""It should not be about relitigating the campaign. The campaign is over. Donald Trump won. Period. Full stop.""
Fallon added that ""dwelling on"" the loss wouldn't be productive for Clinton's former aides, despite the fact it could be soothing.
The news that Russian nationals were regularly communicating with then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and then-adviser Michael Flynn comes as no surprise to the upper echelon of Clinton's campaign. For months before Election Day, Clinton and her aides made the case that Trump was being used by Russia, regularly detailing how Russian President Vladimir Putin was looking to help Trump in an attempt to thwart Clinton.

506,"Washington (CNN) Less than a week before President Donald Trump's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he settled down to dinner to discuss the upcoming visit -- and America's approach to Mideast peace -- with his guests for the evening: billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.
Working dinners have become standard fare for Trump. Long after the President's official day has ended, his workaholic tendencies have him hosting a rotating supper club at the most coveted address in Washington.
At least four nights a week, he welcomes a steady stream of Cabinet members, staffers and members of Congress to the residence to brush up on national security issues and foreign affairs over steak, fish and salads, according to Trump aides.
Since moving to the White House, Trump has dined alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Defense Secretary James Mattis, among others. Some evenings, he'll break bread with top staffers, including senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, chief strategist Steve Bannon or chief of staff Reince Priebus.
The high-intensity working dinners are just one semblance of structure Trump's team has aimed to build around him as the reality television star settles into his new role as the leader of the free world.
The President's operating style
The barrage of meet-and-greets suits Trump's operating style, aides said. He's not a delve-into-a-briefing-book kind of commander in chief. Instead, he learns by peppering people with questions and prefers to pluck opinions from a rotating cast.
But the dinners also ensure the President is engaged well into the evening, allotting less time for some of Trump's less productive pursuits -- gobbling up cable news and engaging in Twitter wars.
In the wake of the travel ban debacle, Trump and his aides have acknowledged they need to move at a more deliberate pace to ensure the President's agenda is executed as seamlessly as possible. Trump himself declared to staffers that things needed to go better.
But while the pace of executive actions and legislation may have slowed, Trump is still operating on overdrive.
""You've never seen so much paper on a President's desk, and it's because we're negotiating lots of deals for our country, which will be tremendous,"" Trump boasted during a recent meeting with the chief executive officer of Intel.
Aides and advisers insist the President is content -- and keeping busy.
""President Trump is brilliant, with the strength and stamina to match,"" said Hope Hicks, Trump's director of strategic communications, when asked about how he's adjusting to the pace of the White House.
Others close to him aren't so sure. They say he feels cooped up in the White House and stymied by the slow confirmation process for many of his Cabinet members. He's still grappling to find a routine that suits his fast-paced preference for doing business.
Family unit missing in White House
Trump has been getting situated in Washington without his wife, first lady Melania Trump, or his 10-year-old son, Barron, by his side. They're expected to move to White House at the end of the school year.
Trump's two adult sons, trusted sounding boards for the President, are engrossed in the day-to-day operations of the family business in Manhattan, leaving Trump in the White House without the familial structure he once relied on.
One Trump ally said his family adds a layer of normalcy to his daily life, an element largely missing in the White House.

""I don't think it's great that he doesn't have Melania and Barron there,"" this person said. ""I think he got really tired of Trump Tower where he couldn't move, and now he's basically got another version of it. But at least she was there.""
Whatever void exists is filled with as much official business as possible -- foreign leader calls, congressional meetings at the White House and huddles with his legislative team.
And then, there are the roundtables.
Trump has held court with airline executives, county sheriffs, small business leaders, Harley Davidson executives, union leaders, cyber security experts, pharmaceutical executives, veterans affairs officials and officers in the Green Beret's Qualifications Course.
""He is first and foremost a 'listener,' "" said one senior administration official. ""Roundtables give folks a chance to actually come in and speak their mind.""
That doesn't always mean he and his guests are tackling the thorniest issues. Natalia Luis, co-owner of the Maryland-based M. Luis Construction Co., appeared with President Barack Obama at the White House during his administration and eagerly accepted an invitation to return for a listening session with Trump.
""I am a product of this country's immigration system and how it can work. I'm also a product of the American dream,"" Luis, an American citizen and Portuguese immigrant, said in an interview. ""With that responsibility on my shoulders comes the responsibility to pay it forward, to give back, to show up, to be at the table.""
While the group spoke about small business regulation, Luis didn't broach Trump's history of provocative comments on immigration.
Avoiding those awkward issues appears to be a common theme for White House invitees. An airline executive insisted Trump's travel ban never came up in their meeting.
Still, Luis was somewhat shocked -- albeit pleasantly -- to be visiting the White House so early in a Trump administration.
""When you're in a presidency and it's nine or 10 days in and you're meeting with someone like me who is such a small dot in this journey we call life, it surprised me, it really did,"" Luis said.

Shaping policy comes with challenges
The roundtables also highlight the campaign mindset that persists in an administration struggling to shape policy without a full Cabinet in place and stocked with aides with little White House experience.
""They've really still got too much campaign in them and not enough governing,"" said a person close to Trump, noting that the lack of a full Cabinet compounds the problem. ""I'm sure the Democrats are doing that to irritate him so he looks like he's irritated. And they're having some success I hate to say.""
Sources close to Trump say the administration is also missing someone to gut check the President and steer him from unnecessary confrontations. It's a void New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had lunch with Trump Tuesday, filled at points throughout the presidential campaign before the relationship between the two men grew strained.
By now, everyone has become accustomed to the fact that Trump sleeps only few hours each night. Aides are often alerted that the President is awake by his early morning tweets, ricocheting across the Internet and, often, driving the agenda for the day. He's on the phone with staffers beginning early in the morning, and doesn't usually end his workday until 11 p.m. or midnight, one administration official said.
Aides have mapped out a rough schedule for him stretching to nearly mid-March, but what the President could truly use is a change of scenery, according to sources close to Trump.
Aides are looking at more opportunities to get him out of Washington, including a visit to South Carolina later this week.
Multiple sources close to the White House said the President would prefer to be on the road -- and adding campaign-style rallies to the mix.
The trips to Mar-a-Lago provide a bit of an escape -- particularly when they're intertwined with work. This weekend he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe there, mingled with the club's members and even popped into a wedding reception in the Grand Ballroom to pose for a photo with the bridesmaids.",negative

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump, who asked for and received then-national security adviser Michael Flynn's resignation Monday, on Wednesday defended the fired aide as ""a wonderful man.""
Flynn, who had deep connections with Trump fostered throughout the 2016 campaign, was asked to resign after it became public that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence on conversations he had before moving into the White House regarding sanctions on Russia with Sergey Kislyak, the Kremlin's man in Washington.
""Gen. Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he has been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media in many cases,"" Trump said. ""And I think it is really a sad thing that he was treated so badly.""
At no point during his answer, however, did Trump acknowledge that he was the person who asked Flynn to resign or explain why he would have asked a ""wonderful man"" to leave his White House.
Trump's comments are at odds with what his top aides said Tuesday after Flynn was let go.

Kellogg -- along with KT McFarland, Flynn's former deputy, and homeland security adviser Tom Bossert -- attempted to quell concerns around Flynn's resignation and job security at the national security body.
It was a tough sell: Many of those in attendance at the National Security Council stayed late into the night Monday to see how things shook out for their former boss and remain concerned that there could be wholesale changes after Flynn's departure.

The Israeli leader and President Donald Trump could both use a boost when they meet Wednesday, particularly before strains develop.

""But for now, there are no major issues between them. It's going to be a honeymoon.""
Trump needs to counter renewed questions about his judgment on international issues after national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned amid questions about his ties to Russia. The President wants to make good on campaign promises to improve ties with Israel and is also considering helping Israel attempt to normalize its relations with Sunni Arab states such as Saudi Arabia.
For his part, Netanyahu is coming off years of a tense and sometimes bitter relationship with President Barack Obama. Bibi, as he's known, is looking to bolster his perch as Israel's steward of the relationship with Washington, in part to defend himself against challenges from right-wing members of his party.
Being one of the first foreign leaders to visit the new US president gives Israel and its leader status. More crucially, it gives him a chance to shape the new US administration's nascent Middle East policy and gain some clarity on mixed and potentially worrying signals for Israel.
As Netanyahu arrives at the White House on Wednesday, he'll be meeting with a US president who hasn't quite decided on key points.
A source with knowledge of the policy deliberations said the White House is still figuring out what its policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be.
""I think they don't know yet,"" the source said.
When it comes to the concept of the two-state solution to the conflict, a bedrock of current US policy, a senior US official said, ""Maybe, maybe not. It's something the two sides have to agree to. It's not for us to impose that vision.""

Already, Arab diplomats who have spoken to the White House have had some affect.
The source said the UAE's ambassador to the US has been ""very influential"" in the process, urging the administration to moderate its stance from Trump's campaign rhetoric.
As a result, the White House has moderated its stance on two key issues: moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and its stance on settlements -- as evidenced by Trump's recent interview with the Israel Hayom newspaper expressing concerns about further construction.
""They've confronted the reality of the situation and the complexity of the situation for the first time,"" this source said. ""What clearly happened was, he heard from the Arabs, which had not happened prior to his victory.""
Should Netanyahu expect detailed assurances from Trump on Wednesday, he is likely to be ""disappointed.""
In addition, Netanyahu might be worried about ""the sheer instability and unpredictability of this president,"" said Dan Shapiro, US ambassador to Israel under Obama. He added that some of the churn is normal for a change in administration, but ""some of it is unique to Trump. Here is a guy who one day can pick a fight with China, Mexico and Australia and the next day walk it back.""
""Netanyahu may be nervous to work with this guy,"" Shapiro said. ""He will want the meeting to be friendly without any problems. But what happens one day if Netanyahu's can't deliver on something? That is when Trump's vindictive side could come out.""
For now, though, ""media expectations are very low, no one is expecting them to come out with announcements"" during this visit, according to former Obama State Department official David Makovsky. Which means, he said, that this moment could be ""a sweet spot"" for both leaders.
The Trump-Netanyahu meeting, set to take place Wednesday at the White House, will cover Iran, Syria, ISIS and the two countries' ties, said White House spokesman Sean Spicer. He also said the two leaders will discuss the prospects for Middle East peace, an effort that Trump has said he wants his son-in-law Jared Kushner to lead.
Kushner has a prior personal relationship with Netanyahu, another way in which those greeting him at the White House are likely to give the Israeli Prime Minister a warmer welcome than he's had in recent years.
The ""administration will work to achieve comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so that Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security,"" Spicer said Tuesday. ""The way forward toward that goal will also be discussed between the President and the Prime Minister.""

Their talks will cover four core areas, with Iran being a primary focus. While Trump had spoken of scrapping the Iran nuclear deal outright, his administration has scaled back and is talking about improving enforcement.
Netanyahu is now ""much more concerned about"" provisions of the deal that expire, said David Makovsky, who worked on the peace process in Obama's State Department and is now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Netanyahu also wants a better understanding of Trump's desire to cooperate with Russia in Syria, which borders Israel. The Russians are working alongside Iran to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. If Trump cooperates with Russia on the fight against ISIS, Israel wants to know how it would affect them, how they can isolate Iran and keep it, or its proxies, away from the southern border with Israel, Makovsky said.
A third issue on the table -- also related to Iran -- is the convergence between Israel and Sunni Arab states. All are concerned about Iran's influence and there has been growing, if discreet, cooperation on intelligence and security matters.
Trump campaigned on a slew of deeply pro-Israel policies, including a stated desire to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move traditionally left for final status talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
And he appointed an ambassador to Israel who has personally supported settlement construction in the West Bank, where Palestinians hope to establish their own state. After Trump's election, a seemingly emboldened Israeli government announced approvals to add thousands more homes in existing settlements and the parliament passed a law legalizing thousands of settler homes in the territory.

But since his inauguration, Trump has moderated from some of those positions. He told an Israeli newspaper that settlements ""don't help the peace process"" and, for now, seems to have backed away from moving the embassy to Jerusalem.
The source with knowledge of the Middle East policy deliberations said that moving the embassy hasn't altogether been taken off the table, but White House officials have been warned about the broader implications such a decision could have in the Arab world.
The source said it appears the administration is moving toward aligning its policy with the George W. Bush administration's, particularly on settlements.
To some degree, the shift in messaging reflects the transition from the campaign to governing, said Shapiro, the former US ambassador to Israel. Promises like the embassy move and signals sent by appointing a settlement-supporting US ambassador are ""running face to face with how it affects other interests,"" Shapiro said. ""The administration is coming to terms with the fact those campaign statements don't hold up against reality.""
Kushner, who Trump has said will be his chief negotiator for Middle East peace, has been making rounds, discussing the situation with influential Arabs, such as Jordan's King Abdullah and UAE ambassador Yousef al-Otaiba. Diplomats say that Kushner has shown he cares about the issue in meetings, saying that while he lacks technical or historical knowledge, he is smart, asks good questions and listens. And they note that he has the most valuable quality of speaking for the President and having his ear.
Arab diplomats saw Trump's slowing down of the embassy and the statement about settlements partly as a product of the conversations Kushner has been having, saying they appear to have sobered the administration a little. For now, it's likely that Trump's Ambassador David Friedman lives and works out of an office in Jerusalem but the full scale relation is put off while the US consults with Israel and allies in the region.
Spicer has said the US is in the ""beginning stages"" of talking to Israel about the embassy.
Meanwhile, Israel has made clear to the US this is not their first priority -- combating Iran, the conflict in Syria and improving relations with Arabs are higher on the list.",negative

Washington (CNN) The president gets to live there, but the White House actually belongs to the American people and starting March 7, they can start to take tours for the first time during Donald Trump's presidency.
First lady Melania Trump said in a statement Tuesday she's looking forward to welcoming visitors.

The White House is a remarkable and historic site and we are excited to share its beauty and history.

The announcement comes as frustration about the closure has mounted on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are often contacted by constituents to schedule White House tours. Without someone to oversee the Visitors Office, a post that under Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama had filled before their respective inauguration days, those tours, and the perk of being able to arrange them, ground to a halt when Trump took office.

520,"(CNN) High-level advisers close to then-presidential nominee Donald Trump were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence, multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials tell CNN.
President-elect Trump and then-President Barack Obama were both briefed on details of the extensive communications between suspected Russian operatives and people associated with the Trump campaign and the Trump business, according to US officials familiar with the matter.
Both the frequency of the communications during early summer and the proximity to Trump of those involved ""raised a red flag"" with US intelligence and law enforcement, according to these officials. The communications were intercepted during routine intelligence collection targeting Russian officials and other Russian nationals known to US intelligence.
Among several senior Trump advisers regularly communicating with Russian nationals were then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and then-adviser Michael Flynn.
Officials emphasized that communications between campaign staff and representatives of foreign governments are not unusual. However, these communications stood out to investigators due to the frequency and the level of the Trump advisers involved. Investigators have not reached a judgment on the intent of those conversations.
Adding to US investigators' concerns were intercepted communications between Russian officials before and after the election discussing their belief that they had special access to Trump, two law enforcement officials tell CNN. These officials cautioned the Russians could have been exaggerating their access.
Trump dismissed the claims that his advisers had close ties to Russia in a tweet Wednesday.
""This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign,"" Trump tweeted.
CNN has reached out to Flynn for comment. In an interview, Manafort emphatically denied that he was in contact with Russians known to US intelligence.
""That is 100% not true, at least as far as me,"" he said. ""I cannot believe that they are including me in anything like that. I have not been involved in any of these activities.""
Manafort said he did not know where US officials got the idea that he was in contact with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign but said he never spoke with any Russian officials during that time.
""I don't remember talking to any Russian officials, ever. Certainly during the time we're talking about,"" he said, calling the allegations ""boggling.""
""I have knowingly never talked to any intelligence official or anyone in Russia regarding anything of what's under investigation,"" he said. ""I have never had any connection to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin or the Russian government before, during or after the campaign.""
Manafort said the FBI has not contacted him about the allegations and said he was not aware of any other Trump campaign officials or people close to Trump being in touch with Russians known to US intelligence.
Manafort, who has held business ties with Russian and Ukrainian individuals, also emphasized that his work for the Yanukovich government in Ukraine should not be interpreted as closeness to the Russians. He said he worked for Yanukovich during a time when Ukraine was ""moving into the European orbit.""
The extensive contacts drew concerns of US intelligence and law enforcement officials in part because it came at a time of Russian cyberactivities targeting mostly Democratic Party political organizations
Post-election intelligence briefings on Russian meddling in the US elections included details of those communications, which included people involved in Trump's businesses.
The communications were gathered as part of routine US intelligence collection and not because people close to Trump were being targeted.
The FBI and US intelligence agencies continue to try to determine what the motive for the communications were.
One concern was whether Trump associates were coordinating with Russian intelligence operatives over the release of damaging information about the Hillary Clinton campaign.
""If that were the case, then that would escalate things,"" one official briefed on the investigation said.",neutral
521,"(CNN) The White House struggled Tuesday to answer an avalanche of questions over national security adviser Michael Flynn's resignation.
Flynn was asked to quit Monday after it became public that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about whether he had discussed US sanctions during pre-inauguration phone calls with the Kremlin's man in Washington, Sergey Kislyak.
In new developments Tuesday, it emerged that President Donald Trump was told on January 26 -- more than two weeks ago -- that the Justice Department had concerns about Flynn's conduct.
Pence did not find out he had been misled until February 9, according to two administration officials.
""It's not that he was being left out. It was a legal review,"" one source said.
When Pence began his inquiry based on Washington Post reporting , ""the timeline moved fast,"" the source said.
A subsequent review by White House counsel Donald McGahn found that he had not broken the law in his conversations with the Russian envoy. If Flynn discussed detailed policy with the Russian envoy, he could have theoretically infringed the Logan Act that prevents private citizens negotiating with foreign governments over their disputes with the United States.

Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said Flynn's resignation was precipitated not by misconduct but by a gradual erosion of the President's confidence in him, including over a ""series of other questionable instances.""
""The level of trust between the President and Gen. Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change,"" Spicer told reporters Tuesday during his daily briefing. ""The President was very concerned that Gen. Flynn had misled the vice president and others.""
A senior administration official later told CNN the other ""questionable instances"" included Flynn's request for a security clearance for his son during the transition. He requested the clearance without telling Pence, who at the time was in charge of the transition.
Trump's growing skepticism about Flynn, however, did not prevent the national security adviser from spending the weekend before his ouster with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Spicer's attempts to put out the firestorm are unlikely to end the saga, not least because several prominent Republicans on Tuesday joined Democrats in calling for congressional probes into Trump's ties to Moscow, an explosive issue given allegations by the US intelligence community that the Kremlin intervened in the presidential election to help him.
Tuesday's developments also left key questions in the intrigue unanswered -- including why it took Trump more than two weeks to push Flynn out after he learned that his national security adviser had not told the truth to Pence.
Flynn was eventually asked to resign on a dramatic day of confusion and conflicting messages from the West Wing, hours after the publication of a Washington Post report that revealed the Justice Department's warning to the White House counsel's office.
Adding to the drama, a White House official said on Tuesday afternoon that the FBI, which is already investigating alleged contacts between Trump surrogates and Russian officials and intermediaries, interviewed Flynn in the early days of the administration about the calls to the Russian ambassador.
The cloud of suspicion still lingering over the White House due to the Flynn affair comes as the new administration is embroiled in multiple controversies and internal staff are infighting as it struggles to find its feet.
It also thrusts Trump's relationship and admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin back in the spotlight.
Many Washington power players have been astonished by the President's frequent defenses of the Russian leader and determination to improve relations with the Kremlin, despite Moscow's turn to Cold War-style confrontational policies in recent years.
Those questions are prompting Republican senators to get more aggressive in searching for answers, despite some resistance to a wider probe in the House.
Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it was ""highly likely"" that the chamber's intelligence committee would look at allegations that Flynn spoke about sanctions with Kislyak.

Sens. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, Roy Blunt and Lindsey Graham also called for an investigation.
""I think Congress needs to be informed of what actually Gen. Flynn said to the Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions,"" Graham told CNN's Kate Bolduan on ""At This Hour.""
""And I want to know, 'Did General Flynn do this by himself or was he directed by somebody to do it?' "" the South Carolina Republican added.
Democrats on Capitol Hill already smell blood, and are demanding congressional probes.
""Let's be clear -- right now, there are way more questions than answers on President Trump's relationship with Russia,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, told reporters.
Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee said, ""The American people deserve to know at whose direction Gen. Flynn was acting when he made these calls, and why the White House waited until these reports were public to take action.""
But the President and some House Republicans pushed back, trying to focus attention on the source of disclosures about Flynn's contacts with Russia that appear to have emerged from intelligence surveillance of the Russian Embassy.
""The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?"" Trump tweeted in his first public reaction to Flynn's departure.
The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017
House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes said the focus of any investigation should be how news of Flynn's calls leaked out.
Democrats and some Republicans are also asking whether Trump instructed Flynn to talk to the Russian ambassador last year about sanctions imposed by the Obama administration to punish alleged Russian interference in the presidential election.
Russia did not respond in its normally aggressive way to the expulsion of alleged agents from its diplomatic posts in the US and the closure of several compounds allegedly used for espionage activities, leading to suspicion that it believed that the Trump administration would act in a way more conducive to Moscow's position.
But Spicer insisted Trump had given no instructions to Flynn to talk about sanctions with Russia.
""Absolutely not, no, no, no,"" Spicer said.

522,"(CNN) Amid an often blistering season on Capitol Hill -- where senators have lobbed unprecedented insults at each other and tangled publicly with the administration -- Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware appears to be among the few trying to lower the temperature in the chamber.
And the White House appears to have noticed.
Coons was the only Democrat from a solidly blue state invited to a meeting between President Donald Trump and eight other senators last week. Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate and would need eight more votes to avoid a filibuster on key issues such as the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch — making every Democratic vote potentially significant.
Coons, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has refused to go as far as some of his Democratic colleagues and call for a filibuster of Trump's Supreme Court nominee, saying he wants to move forward ""one step at a time"" and first hold a hearing and committee vote before deciding any further action.
That doesn't mean he's completely ruled out a filibuster, however. Coons meets with Gorsuch on Tuesday, and he intends to press him on a number of issues, including how Gorsuch would handle further attacks on the judiciary by the President. He's hoping Gorsuch will go beyond comments he made to Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, who said the nominee called Trump's criticism ""disheartening"" and ""demoralizing.""
""We are going to have a constitutional crisis if this President continues in the direction he's headed,"" Coons told CNN in an interview. ""Three weeks as President and this is one of those red lines.""
Coons said ""judicial independence"" is fundamental for constitutional order. ""And if Judge Gorsuch doesn't get that, he doesn't belong on the court.""
Still, while some progressives are calling for Democrats to do whatever they can to stall or block Trump's nominees —especially after Republicans blocked President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nomination last year — Coons has been hesitant to commit to similar stonewalling.
He said it was ""outrageous"" that Republicans refused to give Merrick Garland a hearing last year and that it's ""only human to want some revenge,"" but Democrats need to challenge themselves not ""to act in a petty way.""
""If all we do is continue to exact a pound of flesh from each other, we will eventually strip our republic bare to the bone,"" Coons told reporters recently.
CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on their relationship with Coons but hasn't yet gotten a response.
Coons is keenly aware of the reality that Democrats aren't in control.
""We don't run the Senate. They can have hearings for Judge Gorusch without us--whether we like it or not,"" he told CNN. ""The reality is he's going to get a hearing on the judiciary committee. The challenge is will we fully participate? The more narrow point is: Am I keeping an open mind?""
Presidential interactions
Coons' name has popped up a few times in recent months in association with Trump.
Along with the White House meeting last week, Coons appeared with Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this month, and made a visit to Trump Tower back in December.
The incident raised eyebrows since Coons hails from a blue state where Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton clobbered Trump, 53%-42%. He's also not up for re-election until 2020, so he's not under as much pressure as some other Democrats who are defending their seats next year, especially those from red states that Trump won.
But his recent sightings with Trump don't necessarily suggest the two are striking up a bromance.
Coons was the co-chair of the National Prayer Breakfast, so naturally the two would be seen together at the event. As for his visit to Trump Tower? That was made to formally invite Trump to the breakfast.
The two also traveled to Dover Air Force Base together for the return of the remains of the US service member killed in the raid in Yemen, a relatively common practice for Delaware dignitaries.
In fact, there's plenty of evidence of Coons being critical of Trump, especially during the presidential campaign but also since Trump's inauguration. Coons once called Trump ""a thin-skinned reality TV star"" and ""a Cheeto-faced short-fingered vulgarian,"" according to reports. (He later expressed regret over the comment.)
Coons has so far opposed six of Trump's Cabinet nominees -- Steve Mnuchin, Betsy DeVos, Jeff Sessions, Tom Price, Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo -- and approved three of them--John Kelly, Elaine Chao and James Mattis.
He did not vote on Rex Tillerson for secretary of state because he was on the trip to Dover with Trump during the full Senate vote. And while he told MSNBC that he was considering voting for Tillerson out of concern for whom Trump might pick should Tillerson fail confirmation, he ultimately voted against the former ExxonMobil CEO in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote.
Nonetheless, Coons has been adamant that he's willing to work with the other side.
""I think the only way we have any hope of getting back to a functioning Senate is if we follow the rules and traditions of the Senate,"" he said.
'The Delaware way'
Coons' outlook may be influenced by home state values. Shortly after every Election Day, Delaware has a state holiday called ""Return Day,"" where people gather in Sussex County to announce and celebrate election results. The tradition dates back as far as 1792.
Candidates, both winners and losers, ride together in a parade of horse-drawn carriages and antique cars, then opponents pair up to bury a hatchet in a box of sand. Coons did so in 2010 with his Republican Senate rival, tea party favorite Christine O'Donnell, creating a rather surprising photo opp at the end of a bruising political year.
""I've grown up going to that for decades and it's an important part of our state's culture,"" Coons told CNN. ""We talk about something called the Delaware way, which is how we manage to work together across the aisle.""
That same spirit of bipartisanship was also on display when Delaware's new Democratic Gov. John Carney brought his gubernatorial rival as his guest to Trump's inauguration.
And Coons invited Trump's Delaware campaign chair, Rob Arlett, to the National Prayer Breakfast as his guest. The two men, despite their wildly different political views, say they have a mutual respect for each other, in part because their sons are both high school wrestlers in the same weight class for opposing schools.
Speaking to CNN, Arlett recalled what he considered a remarkable exchange with the senator at an event on Return Day, when Coons came up to Arlett and shook his hand to congratulate him on Trump's win. Coons added that he went onto Trump's website and found three items among Trump's goals for the first 100 days that the senator felt he could start working on with the administration. They involved veterans, infrastructure and manufacturing.
""That was the first conversation that he and I had after the election,"" Arlett said. ""A handshake and an agreement that we have to work together.""
Growing up Republican
Coons grew up as a Republican in a conservative family and volunteered for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1980. He became a Democrat in college, but he said his background helped him better understand the other side.
""When I walk into a room with a Republican senator, I don't walk in assuming that they are mean spirited or wrong headed. I think 'Oh, you know, this person has the view of this uncle or that cousin,'"" he said. ""I think that helps.""
Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia, has worked with Coons on a number of committees as well as legislation and praised his Democratic colleague to CNN Monday. The two formed a friendship not only through legislating but also at the weekly prayer breakfast in the Capitol, according to Isakson, who added that they've ""become best of friends.""
""He legitimately tries to find common ground,"" he said. ""The last question he asks is what party are you from, not the first question.""
Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations committee on which Coons serves, has also worked with the senator on legislation. He painted Coons as ""open minded"" and ""incredibly diligent,"" though he doesn't agree with him on everything.
While Coons described the President as ""alarmingly ungrounded in the traditions of our Constitutional system,"" he said he's determined to work with his colleagues to restore what he sees as a sense of order, even if it can feel instinctual to do the opposite during such highly-charged, emotional times.
""I think the role of the Senate is more important than ever,"" he said.",negative

527,"(CNN) The situation around embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn remained ""fluid"" Monday night -- right up until his resignation.
His departure came just after reports surfaced the Justice Department warned the Trump administration last month that Flynn misled administration officials regarding his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States and was potentially vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians.
""I inadvertently briefed the Vice President-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology,"" Flynn wrote according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by CNN.
The Justice Department concern was raised after Flynn claimed he did not discuss with the Russian ambassador the sanctions being imposed by the Obama administration in retaliation for Russia's interference in the election. Flynn was not yet in government.
The message was delivered by then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. Other top intelligence officials, including James Clapper and John Brennan, were in agreement the White House should be alerted about the concerns.
But Flynn was already in hot water. White House press secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement saying President Donald Trump is ""evaluating the situation"" around Flynn, who is in hot water after possibly misleading Vice President Mike Pence.
The issue stems from whether Flynn discussed sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office and then misled Pence about it. It created a turbulent 72 hours for the White House, leading to questions about Flynn's future after only three weeks.
""The President is evaluating the situation,"" Spicer's statement said. ""He's speaking to the vice president relative to the conversation the vice president had with Gen. Flynn, and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is: our national security.""
The noncommittal statement came shortly after Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the President, told reporters that Trump has ""full confidence"" in Flynn.
""Gen. Flynn does enjoy the full confidence of the President,"" Conway said on MSNBC. She later declined to detail how much the President knew about the issue and when he knew it, deeming those conversation private.
Many inside the Trump administration are concerned with the fact that the national security adviser could have misled senior members of the White House, including Pence, who went on television and denied that Flynn spoke about sanctions with Sergey Kislyak, Russian ambassador to Washington.
Trump, who particularly hates when aides generate negative press, has expressed displeasure with Flynn to aides in recent days, said a source close to the President. Trump and his team are particularly bothered by the possibility that Flynn misrepresented his conversations to Pence.
Flynn spoke with Pence at least twice Friday, according to another White House official who declined to say whether the conversations were about the ongoing controversy. The episode over sanctions against Russia has opened a rift between Flynn and Pence, who exchanged a chilly handshake Friday before Trump's news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Flynn also apologized to Pence and a source says the two ""smoothed things over.""
""The knives are out,"" the official added, acknowledging that Flynn's future in the White House is hardly a sure thing. ""There's a lot of unhappiness about this.""

Administration officials, some of who were once unsure about the details of the story, now believe the national security adviser did, in fact, discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador. A US official confirmed to CNN on Friday that Flynn and Kislyak did speak about sanctions, among other matters, during a December call, contradicting past statements by White House officials.
After the call was made public, Pence told CBS News on January 15 that Flynn did not talk sanctions levied by the Obama administration with Kislyak.
""They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,"" Pence told CBS News.
On Friday, an aide close to the national security adviser told CNN that Flynn could not rule out that he spoke about sanctions on the call.
The White House official blamed much of the outcry against Flynn on a Washington culture that's always in search of a scalp, but people within Trump's orbit were unable to defend Flynn on Sunday.
Stephen Miller, White House policy director, was asked directly about Flynn's future on a number of Sunday talk shows. Miller responded by saying he was not the appropriate official to ask the question, hardly a ringing endorsement from the aide the Trump administration put out to talk on Sunday.
""I don't have any answers today,"" Miller said in response to questions about whether Flynn misled the vice president. ""I don't have any information one way or another to add anything to the conversation.""

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a longtime Trump ally, told CNN's Jake Tapper Flynn needs to clear up his story with Trump and Pence in an interview Sunday on ""State of the Union.""
The White House official, pushing back against the idea that Flynn spoke about sanctions, raised questions about the uproar surrounding Flynn and poked holes in the criticism coming from the general's detractors.
Why, the official said, would a general with years of experience in the intelligence field jeopardize his career by discussing something he likely knew was being recorded.
Trump is also deeply loyal to Flynn: Their relationship stretches further back than many of the national security adviser's White House counterparts.
While Trump's top White House advisers like chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon only came aboard after Trump secured the Republican nomination, Flynn was an early supporter and joined Trump's campaign as his top foreign policy adviser in early 2016.
But Flynn was not just a policy adviser. He also played the role of top surrogate on the campaign trail, seeking to boost Trump's national security bona fides and also leading the charge on political attacks against Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
Flynn was also a contender to join Trump on the Republican ticket as his running mate. But even after he wasn't tapped for the vice presidency, Flynn continued to travel with Trump to most of his political rallies as one of his most trusted advisers in his small circle of aides.

Ivanka Trump helped lead a meeting focused on women in business
Washington (CNN) While the two vastly disagree on a range of issues -- trade, immigration and climate change, to name a few -- US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met Monday on rare common ground, a conciliatory gesture forged in large part by Trump's daughter, Ivanka.
Trudeau sat across the table from Trump in the Cabinet Room, surrounded by a dozen female CEOs and business leaders. The President pledged the launch of the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs, intended to discuss, formulate and implement support for women in the workplace.
To Trudeau's left at the conference table sat Ivanka Trump, who so far been the loudest voice for women's issues in her father's administration.
The President kicked off the meeting by reading from a statement about the initiative's goals, which include growing women-owned businesses, retaining women in the business world, supporting women who work and who have families and helping female entrepreneurs have better access to capital in order to support growing businesses.
Trump thanked Trudeau for coming, and presented him with a photograph of Trump with Trudeau's father, the late former Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau.

Trump's time at the White House has been marked by a number of changes to the office of the presidency, but none may be more public than Trump's reliance on Twitter, especially early in the morning.
The President of the United States had tweeted before 8:15 a.m. ET every weekday morning since taking office, offering his take on negative polls, his replacement on NBC's ""The Apprentice"" and his unsubstantiated claims that ""at least 3,000,000 votes were illegal"" in the 2016 campaign.

President Donald Trump stirred up controversy last week with a tweet on his personal account
(CNN) President Donald Trump is preparing to expand his social media team, big league.
The White House is expected to hire new staffers this week to work with the President on his posts for Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, a senior administration official told CNN.
Up until now, Trump and his social media director Dan Scavino have essentially handled the President's tweets on their own. Trump typically dictates his often provocative Twitter posts to Scavino who then hits ""tweet.""
Scavino, a longtime aide who worked his way up from the job of caddy to general manager at one of Trump's golf courses, then on to social media director during the campaign, has carried much of the White House digital load himself at all hours of the day and night.

533,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's patio strategy session at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday evening is drawing scrutiny for its open-air nature, including aides' use of cell phone flashlights to illuminate potentially sensitive documents.
As Trump discussed a response to North Korea's missile test with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, other diners looked on freely.
Sources who don't work in national security or government but were also dining on the patio Saturday evening couldn't say whether the conversations or documents were classified. The White House didn't respond to a request for information about how sensitive information is treated at Trump's Florida estate.
But the episode -- which was documented by diners in photographs on Facebook -- does raise questions about how the Trump administration will handle foreign policy crises on the road.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted Monday: ""There's no excuse for letting an international crisis play out in front of a bunch of country club members like dinner theater.""

Presidents always travel with secure communications equipment, even when they're on vacation. A Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, known as a SCIFF, also comes along. The tent-like structure can fit inside a hotel room and allows a president to conduct sensitive phone calls without the risk of being detected by recording devices.
At Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, it had not been immediately clear whether Trump utilized that equipment, but White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Monday he had.
""The President was briefed in a SCIFF prior to dinner,"" Spicer told reporters Monday. ""They were reviewing the logistics for the press conference ... President was subsequently briefed in a classified setting.""
Trump was spotted speaking on a cell phone at his dinner table as advisers surrounded him to develop a response to the missile launch. Sheets of paper were produced and read with the assistance of flashlights on aides' cell phones -- which, if compromised, could also act as cameras or recording devices.
On Facebook, fellow diners posted photos of the action, including one with a flash bulb illuminating a piece of paper held in front of Abe.
""It was fascinating to watch the flurry of activity at dinner when the news came that North Korea had launched a missile in the direction of Japan,"" Richard DeAgazio wrote in his post. ""The Prime Minister Abe of Japan huddles with his staff and the President is on the phone with Washington DC. the two world leaders then conferred and then went into another room for hastily arranged press conference. Wow.....the center of the action!!!""
DeAgazio told The Washington Post in an interview he couldn't overhear what was being said due to the background noise.
""You don't hear anything. You can't hear,"" DeAgazio said. ""I mean, I can barely hear what's going on at my table.""
The Post said he deleted his Facebook account after the interview.
Below DeAgazio's pictures, other diners chimed in.

Trump's approval rating is markedly lower than his predecessors at the same point in their terms
(CNN) President Donald Trump's approval rating reached a new low Saturday, according to a poll from Gallup, as the new administration has struggled to find its footing nearly a month into the term.
The daily tracking poll found that just 40% of Americans approve of President Trump's job as president so far, compared to 55% who say the disapprove. The negative 15-point spread is the highest recorded in the poll since Trump took office January 20.
Trump's approval rating has hovered in the mid-to-low 40s since the second week of his presidency, but the new poll suggests growing dissatisfaction with his performance amid the chaotic rollout of his controversial travel ban and a series of divisive Cabinet confirmation fights.
Trump's low approval rating is atypical for a new president. Former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton all enjoyed approval ratings in the high 50s in Gallup tracking polls during the early months of their administrations.

Fort Bragg, North Carolina (CNN) The defense team of US Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl argued Monday he is unable to have a fair trial because of numerous comments made by then-candidate, now President Donald Trump on the 2016 campaign trail.
Shortly after the President's inauguration, Bergdahl's defense attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the charges after Trump repeatedly called the sergeant a ""traitor"" during the 2016 presidential campaign.
The defense, led by Eugene Fidell, played pieces of a 28-minute video in which Trump repeatedly refers to Bergdahl as a ""traitor."" They claim that ""Trump's statements are prejudicial to Sergeant Bergdahl's right to a fair trial,"" according to the motion filed last month. Their main argument was that Trump's comments constituted ""unlawful command influence,"" (UCI) which would make it impossible for Bergdahl to receive a fair trial because the commander in chief has disparaged him multiple times.
Army Judge Col. Jeffery R. Nance would not allow the defense to play all 28 minutes. He asked Fidell to play the points that best made his argument. Fidell requested to play five minutes from the beginning of the video and two from the end.

538,"(CNN) The iceberg wedge salads, dripping with blue cheese dressing, had just been served on the terrace of Mar-a-Lago Saturday when the call to President Donald Trump came in: North Korea had launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile , its first challenge to international rules since Trump was sworn in three weeks ago.
The launch, which wasn't expected, presented Trump with one of the first breaking national security incidents of his presidency. It also noisily disrupted what was meant to be an easygoing weekend of high-level male bonding with the more sobering aspects of global diplomacy.
Sitting alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom he'd spent most of the day golfing, Trump took the call on a mobile phone at his table, which was set squarely in the middle of the private club's dining area.

As Mar-a-Lago's wealthy members looked on from their tables, and with a keyboard player crooning in the background, Trump and Abe's evening meal quickly morphed into a strategy session, the decision-making on full view to fellow diners, who described it in detail to CNN.
News of Pyongyang's launch had emerged an hour earlier, as Trump was preparing for dinner in his residence. Officials had concluded the Musudan-level missile flew 310 miles off North Korea's eastern coast before crashing into the Sea of Japan.
For the new commander in chief, the launch was his first brush with the hermit regime's saber-rattling, which along with heated rhetoric from the young leader Kim Jong-un has spooked the country's neighbors. During his pre-election intelligence briefings, Trump requested supplemental information about North Korea from US intelligence officials. National security analysts have identified the nation's nuclear program as one of the imminent threats facing Trump as he begins his tenure in the White House.
In his talks with Abe at the White House on Friday, the North Korea threat weighed heavily. Abe said during a concluding news conference that he and Trump had agreed to ""strongly demand"" the country ""abandon (its) nuclear and ballistic missile program."" They departed a short time later for Florida.
On Saturday evening, as the two men walked through Mar-a-Lago's ornate wrought-iron doors on their way to dinner, neither responded to questions about the launch from reporters.
Swanning through the club's living room and main dining area alongside Abe, Trump was -- as is now typical -- swarmed with paying members, who now view dinner at the club as an opportunity for a few seconds of face time with the new President.
But as he sat down for the planned working dinner with Abe, whose country is well within range of North Korea's missiles, it was clear his counterpart felt it necessary to respond to the test. The launch occurred just before 8 a.m. on Sunday morning in Japan.
Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn and chief strategist Steve Bannon left their seats to huddle closer to Trump as documents were produced and phone calls were placed to officials in Washington and Tokyo.

Earlier in the day, the women had toured a nearby Japanese garden and visited the gothic Bethesda-by-the-Sea church, where Trump and his wife were married in 2005.
Eventually Trump and Abe, along with their collection of aides, stood and moved from the dining terrace and toward a marble-trimmed ballroom, whose gilded columns were concealed by more sober-looking black drapes.

But a now series of scandals -- and a new neighbor in the White House -- have ushered in a good dose of gloom.
""He has enjoyed an historic and exceptional honeymoon,"" pollster Nik Nanos of Nanos Research said. ""Now, the shine is off.""
With his popularity slipping and the challenges of Donald Trump's administration mounting -- the two leaders are due to meet Monday at the White House -- Trudeau might well be sensing a storm.
Here's how he got to this point:
From bouncer to Prime Minister
His jobs have varied from nightclub bouncer to teacher. A married father of three, Trudeau is an avid athlete who runs, skis, surfs, boxes -- he's even mastered yoga. And from his shirtless encounters with strangers to an official visit with a blushing Catherine Duchess of Cambridge, Trudeau has charmed the world one selfie at a time.

In May 2016, while debating a contentious piece of legislation on assisted suicide, Trudeau ""manhandled"" a member of Parliament and elbowed another, apparently swearing as he went.

He apologized, twice, and the negative attention was mostly limited to Canada.
No such luck for Trudeau's next misstep.
As the world reacted to the death of Fidel Castro, Trudeau said in a statement that the Cuban leader had been a ""larger than life leader who served his people."" He left out any mention of Castro's record on human rights and his history of oppression.

The criticism poured in. #TrudeauEulogies started trending, with mock tributes to despots past and present. In the end, Trudeau agreed that Castro was a dictator.
Even before that ruckus could die down, Trudeau found himself in the middle of yet another scandal. His office confirmed that the Prime Minister spent his winter holiday on the private island of the Aga Khan -- and used the billionaire religious leader's private helicopter to get there. An ethics investigation is underway.
And no sooner had the new year begun than tragedy struck in Quebec City , where a local college student allegedly shot to death six men at a mosque. It was one of the worst attacks to target Muslims in a Western country.
Make Trudeau great again
Trudeau used the massacre to double down on his message of inclusion . ""Muslim-Canadians are an important part of our national fabric,"" he said.
Trudeau speaks during a rally near the Islamic Cultural Center in Quebec City on January 30.
The attack came as Trudeau, aware of his waning popularity and aiming to shed the label of ""limousine liberal,"" embarked on a cross-country town hall road show
He got grilled, heckled and yelled at.
But some commentators saw it as a successful act of contrition after several weeks of damaging missteps.
""That's why he did this incredible tour of the country that no one's ever seen before,"" said Craig Oliver , chief political commentator for CTV News.
""He's authentic,"" said Oliver, who has known Trudeau since childhood. ""He has real good instincts about people and about politics.""
'Sunny ways' still under threat
As he works to dig out of his domestic rut, Trudeau faces new threats to his progressive politics. There's still a strain of nationalist populism that runs deep in Canada.
Oh, and then there's Donald Trump.
Former Vice President Joe Biden suggested weeks before he left office that Trudeau, along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, would inherit the liberal mantle from former President Barack Obama.
The Trudeaus and the Obamas at the White House on March 10.
""The world's going to spend a lot of time looking to you, Prime Minister, as we see more and more challenges to the liberal international order since the end of World War II,"" Biden said.
But is Trudeau up to the task?
The Prime Minister is an avowed feminist, free-trader and self-appointed cheerleader for diversity. And just a week before Trump was sworn in, Trudeau issued a thinly veiled swipe at his new American counterpart.
""There are things that we hold dear that the Americans haven't prioritized,"" he said at a town hall event. ""And I'm never going to shy away from standing up for what I believe in -- whether it's proclaiming loudly to the world that I am a feminist, whether it's understanding that immigration is a source of strength for us and Muslim-Canadians are an essential part of the success of our country today and into the future.""
After the Trump administration announced its travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries , Trudeau tweeted, ""To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada""
To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017
""Almost everything that Trump represents, Trudeau resents,"" Oliver said.
Face to face with Trump
As Trudeau preps for his meeting with Trump, some say he should remember the words of his late father, who in the 1960s said that living next to the United States was like ""sleeping with an elephant"" -- every ""twitch and grunt"" affects you.
""Agitating the President of the United States is not a good strategy especially when the President is Donald Trump because he has such a thin skin,"" pollster Nanos said.
Trudeau and Trump are sure to agree on some issues, including support of the Keystone XL Pipeline . But for Trudeau, nearly every facet of his country's economy could be affected by his relationship with Trump.
""There's just so much riding on it,"" Oliver said. ""You know, 75% of Canada's goods are sold in the United States. That border has to stay open for business.""
For his part, Trudeau said as much last week during a public appearance ahead of his White House visit.
""We both got elected on commitments to strengthen the middle class and support those working hard to join it,"" the Prime Minister said. ""And that's exactly what we're gonna be focused on in these meetings -- making sure that the millions of good, middle-class jobs on both side of our borders that are dependent on the smooth flow of goods and services and people back and forth across our border are reinforcing the deep connections and friendship between Canada and the United States.""",negative

547,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's persistent and unprecedented criticisms of judges and the judiciary at large have incited outrage on both sides of the legal community and prompted some to wonder if Chief Justice John Roberts should publicly come to the defense of his robed colleagues.
The chief justice also heads the Judicial Conference of the US -- the policy making body for the federal courts — and has defended his fellow jurists before. But Roberts has remained silent.
Some have called for Roberts to issue a statement. Richard L. Hasen of the University of California Irvine wrote recently, ""There is someone else who should speak up for an independent judiciary, and that's the Chief Justice.""
But that is not likely to happen. Roberts walks a careful line supporting the judiciary but keeping it far from the political dysfunction that has consumed the other two branches. When a political storm erupts, he strategically decides when to insert himself.
Like most judges, Roberts treasures the idea of impartiality, and he also cares more than most about the legitimacy of the courts. As such, often his rule is to refrain from entering the immediate fray, but to circle back when the winds have died down.

549,"(CNN) On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump promised to take a blowtorch and pliers to the Washington political establishment.
But three weeks into his presidency, he has been repeatedly disarmed and frustrated by partisan opponents and the machinery of a government designed to check his power.
It hasn't been for a lack of trying. Trump over his first 21 days in office has issued a barrage of executive actions aimed at delivering on a range of policy pledges -- including many of his most aggressive and controversial. But the January 27 travel ban has become a millstone on the neck of a young administration that has spent the last two weeks digging deeper into a legal battle that now seems destined for the Supreme Court.
Much of the emerging image of dysfunction has been painted by Trump's own staff. The calls are coming from inside the White House -- and they are going to reporters , who have been flooded with accounts of a frenetic and angry president, who bounces from political frustration to personal grudge -- often in his bathrobe , according to a New York Times account disputed by the White House -- in the space of a few minutes.
Now, with the foot soldiers of his Republican majority under siege in their home districts , the blustering outsider who chalked up his predecessors' failures to their lack of will or guile, is seeing his own challenged daily.
A growing barrier to 'The Wall'
""I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively,"" Trump said during his June 2015 campaign kick-off. ""I will build a great great wall on our southern border and I'll have Mexico pay for that wall.""
Trump's promise to build a wall on the southern border was a consistent crowd-pleaser during the campaign. Congressional Republicans have vowed to finance its construction, but have been short on the how and when details.
His guarantee that the Mexican government would foot the bill, which could, according a Reuters report out Thursday, cost more than $20 billion, had been one of the pitch's key selling point. But their president, under pressure at home, has balked and dismissed it out of hand. When the White House floated a 20% tariff on Mexican imports to cover the upfront costs, there was a rare bipartisan meltdown and the trial balloon was quickly deflated.
Repeal and replace Obamacare with ... what?
""Something terrific,"" Trump said during a July 2015 interview with CNN's Dana Bash , who asked what he would push in place of Obamacare.
Pressed to provide a bit more detail, Trump advocated for allowing people to buy insurance across state lines. But that carries concerns for critics from both sides of the aisle.
It's been more than 18 months since that conversation -- and nearly seven years since President Barack Obama signed and Affordable Care Act into law -- but Trump and Republicans do not yet have a viable replacement to shop. In a Sunday interview with Fox News, the President called the process ""very complicated"" and suggested it could last into 2018 -- a midterm election year.
And with demonstrators flooding town hall meetings to rail against Republicans' health care plan, or a convincing lack thereof, full repeal seems a long ways off.

Some doubts on the homefront
A little more than a week before his inauguration, Trump declared at a wild press conference in New York that ""Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.""
JUST WATCHED Watch the entire Donald Trump news conference Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch the entire Donald Trump news conference 56:51
Trump during his campaign, and after being elected, asserted over and again the US, mostly because of Obama, had been diminished in the eyes of the world. He pledged to reverse that and restore those purported losses.
While it's unclear exactly how outsiders' views of the US have shifted over the past three weeks, Gallup found that only 29% Americans believe ""other countries around the world have respect for the president."" Two-thirds of respondents said they did not.
Here's how those numbers stack up against Presidents Obama and George W. Bush at similar stages of their first terms:
Travel ban and a reckoning with the courts
The executive order, which also paused the US refugee program and halted the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely, set off mass protests around the country. Within 24 hours, judges were hearing arguments against it. Now, after seeing it blocked in multiple venues, Trump will have to decide if he wants a Supreme Court showdown or to go back to the drawing board.
JUST WATCHED Trump hints at new security measures Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump hints at new security measures 00:54
On Friday, he signaled both options remained on the table. And more pointedly, doubled down on his argument in favor of some kind of ban.
""There are tremendous threats to our country,"" he said during a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, eschewing specifics but suggesting that he, as President, was privy to information that would shake the broader public.
However it plays out, what's clear now is that Trump's December 2015 announcement ""calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"" is a long way off -- and even more measured versions have significant challenges ahead.
Sanctuary cities no harbor for Trump's policies
In another early executive action, Trump signed an order seeking to ""ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law.""
Delivered days before the travel ban, this too set off an avalanche of protest, both in the streets and among mostly Democratic leaders in major urban centers like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Smaller cities like New Haven, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas, have also threatened to fight back in court.

And in an ironic twist, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (among others) pointed to a 2012 Supreme Court case to explain why they're so confident. The ruling in NFIB vs. Sebelius , which allowed states to reject Medicaid expansion without the threat of losing pre-existing funds, set a precedent Trump's opponents say will prevent him from using federal money as a tool to coerce local governments.
In the private dealings of his family business, Trump's decision-making went unquestioned -- at least publicly. But the presidency is ruled by a different calculus, one its new resident, three weeks into his four year term, is struggling to command.",negative
550,"Story highlights There's no exact figure for the cost of President Donald Trump's border wall
Republican lawmakers have pushed back on funding the project
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump vowed Saturday to keep costs down on his proposed wall along the US border with Mexico, although he did not specify how much one of his signature campaign promises would cost.
""I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in ... the design or negotiations yet,"" Trump wrote in a series of two consecutive tweets. ""When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN!""
The President has not yet released a specific plan for the wall, including an exact cost, though on the campaign trail Trump has cited a $10 billion estimate from the National Precast Concrete Association. But other outside estimates suggest there are enough variables to cost up to $15 billion, and possibly as much as $25 billion, according to a report from Bernstein Research.
The President campaigned on building a wall along its Southern border to stop illegal immigration, and even before occupying the White House, Trump's transition team began discussing plans for the wall with the US Army Corps of Engineers and Interior Department.

Spicer insisted Thursday that Trump knew what the US-Russia New START agreement was during his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and was merely seeking an opinion from an aide when he paused during the conversation.

Acting more as a statesman than a populist insurgent candidate, Trump implied he will operate within the conventional US foreign policy framework towards Asia and soothed global fears that he intends a wholesale rejection of the international system.
Trump reaffirmed the two central planks of US Asia policy that have prevailed for decades during a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping late Thursday and in welcoming Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to Washington Friday.
He pledged to Xi that he would respect the ""One China"" policy under which the US doesn't grant diplomatic recognition to Taiwan -- which is regarded by Beijing as a renegade province -- despite earlier warning that he might use the issue as leverage in trade talks.

Hours after the call with Xi, Trump wrapped Abe in a hug and shook his hand for a full 19 seconds in the Oval Office. He renewed US security guarantees to Japan and stressed the importance of stationing American troops in the East Asian country, despite saying during his campaign that Tokyo should pay more for US protection and perhaps get its own nuclear weapons.
""It is important that both Japan and the United States continue to invest very heavily in the alliance to build up our defense and our defensive capabilities,"" Trump said alongside Abe at a White House news conference Friday. ""I also want to take this opportunity, Mr. Prime Minister, to thank you and the people of Japan for hosting our armed forces.""
It was a startling turn of events that suggested even a president as unconventional as Trump is prone to sharp turns once he sheds the cloak of presidential candidate for the mantle of commander in chief.
And while he has frequently billed himself as a master dealmaker, it did not appear that the President extracted any concessions from either Japan or China to earn his change in position -- other than traditional vows to foster cooperation and stability to defuse South China Sea tensions and mitigate the threat from North Korea's nuclear program.
Trump's move may also reassure other allies who viewed Trump's election with alarm following signs he was looking to disrupt the national security architecture that has kept the peace for 70-plus years just as he shook up American politics.

""Striking"" is how Matt Goodman, a senior advisor for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described Trump's rhetorical shift on Japan and China.
He attributed the ""much softer and more constructive"" tone to the possibility that ""the adults around him are starting to normalize some of these policies,"" pointing to Cabinet members including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis.
These advisors might be ""starting to say that we need to handle all of this in a more traditional way"" and ""tack back"" to established positions.
Trump's new-found respect for diplomatic norms might also be a tactical move with respect to China, Goodman suggested.
Given the sudden warmth in the US-Japan friendship, ""perhaps he doesn't want to seem overly antagonistic to China,"" Goodman said.
The White House might want to ratchet down tensions with Beijing -- particularly because it may soon crank them back up.
The President's shift on China represents a complete tonal about-face.
In his campaign, Trump accused Beijing of raping the US industrial base and vowed to brand the Asian giant as a currency manipulator on Day One of his administration -- a step he has yet to take.
During his transition, Trump sparked uproar and sharp pushback in the Chinese official media by becoming the first known President-elect to take a call from a Taiwanese president, when he spoke to Tsai Ing-wen.\
Then he told The Wall Street Journal that he might use the status of Taiwan -- an existential issue for China's Communist leaders -- as a bargaining chip in trade talks with Beijing.

At the time, some of Trump's defenders argued that the apparent rejection of the ""One China"" bedrock policy was evidence of his shrewd ""Art of the Deal"" negotiating style that could drive a new bargain for the US with China.
Under the ""One China"" policy, nations that have diplomatic relations with Beijing agree not to grant diplomatic recognition to Taiwan. US law, however, requires the President to provide the island with the means to defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act, which also governs cultural and non-official relations between the two government.
But administration officials could point to no new concessions from Beijing on Friday that accompanied the President's shift in position.
In fact, ever since the start of the administration, the US National Security Council has been making behind the scenes moves to improve contacts with Beijing.
Earlier this week, Trump sent Xi a letter congratulating him on Lunar New Year. And a video of Trump's granddaughter reciting Chinese poetry in Mandarin went viral in China, an event that was seen as an icebreaker amid rumors in the Washington foreign policy establishment that Xi was not willing to get on the phone with Trump without an assurance he would respect the ""One China"" paradigm.
But come Thursday, Trump was ready to do so and to say so publicly.
""President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our 'One China' policy,"" a White House readout of the call said.
The transformation in Trump's position on China was mirrored by a similar shift on Japan, previewed by Mattis during a tour of the region last week.

The President renewed US security guarantees to its Northeast Asian ally, including those that cover an island chain that is administered by Japan, which calls it the Senkakus, and claimed by China, which uses the name Diaoyu.
Washington and Tokyo said that they would both invest in defense, but Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Norio Maruyama said that the issue of Japan paying the US more for its security shield and basing American troops on its soil did not come up.
""There was not mention about cost sharing at this stage,"" said Maruyama. ""We consider this an issue that belongs to the past.""
A senior administration official did not dispute the difference between Trump's campaign trail and presidential positions.
But the official rejected the notion that the new administration was simply adopting strategies pursued by previous White Houses -- especially those in the ""pivot to Asia"" strategy of President Barack Obama. The aide noted that Trump had already pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- a huge multilateral trade deal at the centerpiece of Obama's Asia rebalance that Trump believes would move American jobs to low-wage economies abroad.
""I certainly think it is pretty different from what we have seen in the last eight years,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""The President is not interested in a flawed, counterproductive trade deal that was the centerpiece of Obama policies,"" the official continued. ""He is engaging in what any responsible new President would do in the both the Xi call and the Abe visit: expanding relationships with significant world leaders.""
The administration's evolution on Asia policy does not mean it's going to be smooth sailing from here on.
Tensions are certain to bubble up between Washington and Beijing over the latter's expanding military role and projection of power around the world. China, for its part, wants the US to recommit to the Paris treaty on climate change signed under Obama.
And trade disputes are likely to batter the relations between the US and the two Northeast Asian rivals, especially since Trump made their economic practices such a large part of his political rhetoric.
But for American allies -- and even adversaries like China -- that may seem far more like business as usual from Trump than they expected during his fiery presidential campaign.",negative

It's essentially playing tour guide, but it's part of the role of representing the Administration and playing gracious hostess to very VIP out of town guests.
Melania Trump appears to be breaking with this particular tradition.
On two pre-scheduled Washington stops Friday, one to Gallaudet University and the other to attend a National Cherry Blossom Festival committee meeting at the Japanese embassy, the first lady of Japan, Akie Abe, was alone, without Mrs. Trump to guide her.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did some of his own solo touring. He laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. Remains there include unknown service members killed in World War II. Prime Minister Abe met with President Trump at the White House and took questions from reporters in a joint press conference.
Mrs. Trump, who has decided to live in New York through the end of the school year with her and the President's son Barron, was on hand to greet the Abes Friday afternoon and flew with them and her husband aboard Air Force One to Palm Beach, Florida, for a weekend stay at Mar-a-Lago.

559,"Story highlights Two Paths America will push for conservative causes and political bridge building
It is unclear if Kasich will go so far as challenging Trump in a 2020 GOP primary
Washington (CNN) Just three weeks into Donald Trump's presidency, associates of former Republican primary rival John Kasich are already positioning him as the GOP's Trump alternative, launching a new political organization to champion his campaign themes -- from political tolerance to fiscal discipline.
The organization, called Two Paths America, will push for a balanced budget amendment, strong national defense and political bridge building.
""We believe there is more that brings us together than divides us, and that when we do come together, when we unite, America always wins,"" the homepage of the group's new website reads.
Two Paths America is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit political organization. It will advocate for policy and ideas and be run by longtime Kasich aides like John Weaver and Chris Schrimpf, but the Ohio governor will not technically be involved. However, Kasich's campaign apparatus, Kasich for America, continues to exist as well as his Super PAC, New Day for America.
Kasich was one of the last of the 17 Republican presidential candidates to drop out of the race, despite only winning one GOP primary -- that of his home state.

President Donald Trump has labeled the Iran nuclear agreement a ""terrible deal""
Washington (CNN) The United States is committed to the ""full implementation"" of the Iran nuclear deal, the European Union's foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said Friday.
""I was reassured by what I heard in my meetings on the intention to stick to the full and strict implementation of the agreement in all its part,"" Mogherini told France 24.
After two days of meetings with US officials, Mogherini said she will ""return from Washington tomorrow reassured that the United States is committed to the full implementation of this deal.""
Iran was Mogherini's priority on this visit, she said, but she also came to draw some clear lines for the new administration. The EU-US relationship may be changing, she said, but the 28-member bloc remains committed to policies on issues such as Middle East peace, refugees and Russia, even as they diverge from US positions.
""A new era in our relationship can mean that we can enter into a more pragmatic and transactional time,"" Mogherini said. ""This can also mean that we differ in our political views from time to time and that we will be very clear on this.""

561,"(CNN) Elliott Abrams, who served Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, will not get the No. 2 job at the State Department, three Republican sources told CNN.
But Abrams was nixed from the list of contenders after President Donald Trump learned of Abrams' biting criticism last May of his fitness to become president, the Republican sources said.
The President found out about Abrams' outspokenness against Trump after meeting with him on Tuesday to consider him for the position, which would have made him Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's deputy. The meeting went well, but Trump could not get past Abrams' past criticism, the sources said.
Abrams, Bush's deputy national security adviser, had emerged as the top contender to become Tillerson's right-hand man.
""This is a loss for the State Department and the country and, for that matter, for the President,"" said one Republican source.
Another Republican source with knowledge of what happened said Abrams would not get the job because of ""Donald Trump's thin skin and nothing else.""
Tillerson tried to convince Trump to make Abrams his deputy despite the criticism because he felt he needed his foreign policy experience, according to multiple sources. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Jared Kushner also strongly supported Abrams and urged Trump to reconsider, the sources said.
Abrams penned an opinion piece in May in The Weekly Standard titled "" When You Can't Stand Your Candidate "" after Trump clinched enough support to become the GOP's presumptive nominee.
""The party has nominated someone who cannot win and should not be president of the United States,"" Abrams wrote in the first line of the article.
Despite that critique, Abrams never signed any of the open letters top GOP foreign policy officials penned opposing Trump's nomination.
The criticism went both ways. Trump has lambasted politics advocated by the former national security official.
While in the White House, Abrams supported the Iraq War, which Trump backed in its early days but soon vigorously opposed -- particularly on the 2016 campaign trail -- as a ""stupid"" decision.
And Trump has frequently argued against other views embraced by neoconservatives like Abrams, including that the US has wasted too many resources abroad, particularly in trying to promote democracies in the Middle East -- a key tenet of the Bush administration.",negative
562,"He ran smack into the limits of executive power.
Three federal judges unanimously refused to restore the White House's controversial travel ban, laying down the most significant marker yet that Trump's vision of an administration rooted in the muscular use of executive power -- similar to that he enjoyed as a business leader -- will not go unchallenged.
In a stinging rebuke, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the administration's argument that the judiciary lacked the authority to block the travel ban as ""contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.""
The tone and content of the decision immediately called into question Trump's gamble in enacting such a fundamental reshaping of the nation's immigration laws through presidential order rather than a law debated and passed by Congress.
And he might not be done yet. Asked if Trump was considering signing a new immigration executive order in the wake of the court's decision, a White House official said Friday that he hasn't ruled anything out.
""Nothing's off the table,"" the official said.
New doubts
The embarrassment of Thursday's ruling raises new doubts about the effectiveness of the President's unorthodox method of doing business. In this case, the tendency to draw up plans without much outside input has not served the White House well. The relative inexperience of Trump's core advisers may also have been a factor.
It is now certain that the saga of the immigration ban, which has consumed the presidency for two of its three weeks and is distracting from other priorities, will run on indefinitely with possible damaging consequences for the young administration.
But the President, who came to office predicting an avalanche of wins and warning that only he could fix the multiple crises he diagnosed as ailing the national soul, is a long way from admitting a final defeat. Drawing on the pugilistic instincts that sustained his business career, he dug in for a counter attack.
""SEE YOU IN COURT,"" Trump tweeted minutes after the ruling came down, previewing a possible appeal to the Supreme Court that would set up an even more dramatic and consequential showdown.
A few minutes later, the President began the task of using the decision to galvanize his devoted armies of supporters who sent him to Washington to carry out reforms exactly on the lines of his original executive order.
""It's a political decision, we're going to see them in court, and I look forward to doing that,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""We have a situation where the security of our country is at stake and it's a very very serious situation.""
The ruling came with Trump waging feuds on multiple fronts with various lawmakers on Capitol Hill and with his own approval ratings at lower levels than ever seen for a newly inaugurated president.
Democratic opponents hailed the decision as an affirmation of the principles on which the nation is based and a precursor of likely pitched legal battles to come on the extent of Trump's power.
'Check and balance'
""I am pleased that our check and balance system is working in this country,"" Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""It shows that the courts are going to be there when President Trump uses his power and exceeds his constitutional authority. I think that is an important message that our constitutional system will work.""
But the President's allies quickly moved to contain the damage and to frame the terms of the political and legal fight ahead.
Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton said the order was plainly legal and argued the courts shouldn't second guess the national security decisions of the president.
""This misguided ruling is from the Ninth Circuit, the most notoriously left-wing court in America and the most reversed court at the Supreme Court,"" Cotton said. ""I'm confident the administration's position will ultimately prevail.""
The Supreme Court could still rule in favor of the administration, either on the merits of the case or the issue of standing of foreigners on whose behalf the challenge to Trump's executive order was brought by the state of Washington.
But the possibility of the nation's highest bench being called upon to clear up a growing legal imbroglio will also open a new political fight. The Supreme Court is currently lacking its ninth member owing to the prolonged Washington standoff following the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia.
Should the Court hear the case and split 4-4, the ruling of the 9th Circuit would be affirmed. That fact alone adds heat to the confirmation duel looming over the nomination of Trump's first Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch.
Republicans now have even more of an incentive to ram the confirmation through the Senate using the ""nuclear option"" to sidestep a Democratic filibuster. Democrats are even less likely to cooperate with a swift process.
JUST WATCHED Who is Judge Neil Gorsuch? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is Judge Neil Gorsuch? 00:48
The 9th Circuit decision, however, seemed designed to shape the future arguments about the content of the executive order and the administration's attempts to significantly stiffen the government's anti-terrorism campaign.
It went far further in its ruling than the simple question of the stay on the travel ban imposed by a lower court, taking pains to dismantle the administration's assertion that the travel ban was vital to protecting Americans against an influx of foreign terror threats from the seven named nations, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Syria.
""The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,"" the ruling said.
""Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all.""
Several options
The stinging ruling presented the President with several options , including an immediate appeal to the Supreme Court.
Trump also has the option of going back to the drawing board and coming up with a new way to impose ""extreme vetting"" restrictions he says are necessary.
But it seems certain he will not take the route since to do so would involve not only admitting the bitter taste of a high stakes legal defeat but repudiating the combative win-at-all-costs attitude that animates his character.
""The President has lost so he is now in a state of limbo. For weeks perhaps even months his order is going to be stayed,"" Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, told CNN's Erin Burnett. ""He claims that this is a threat to the national security of the United States. If he is right, then he has only one option -- rescind the order, start from scratch ... write a new order that will both protect the security of the United States and avoid constitutional challenge.""
Dershowitz added: ""But it would require him to admit that he is wrong. So now there is a clash between the ego of the President and the national security of the United States.""",negative

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump taunted Democrats by telling them ""Pocahontas is now the face of your party"" -- his insult of choice for Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- during a meeting with senators earlier this week, sources told CNN.
The President also used the Thursday meeting at the White House to again surface unfounded claims of voter fraud during the 2016 presidential election.
The sources said the Warren moment came up in the context of Trump's impromptu analysis of the state of the Democratic Party. Trump made his comments in what appeared to be a reference to Warren's criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions during his confirmation process. Her comments prompted Republicans to invoke an arcane rule to cut her off.

564,"Washington (CNN) When Beyoncé got political and paid tribute to the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement at the Super Bowl last year, many sports fans were up in arms, accusing the star of violating what some consider to be an unspoken rule: Keep politics out of sports.
But in an America that is still reeling from a divisive presidential election cycle, where the rise of President Donald Trump catapulted heated debates over race and social issues into the mainstream, many athletes are becoming politically active in a way not seen in decades. And not everyone is happy about it.
""Sports is really no longer an escape from the real world that it used to be. Sports is a mirror of our society,"" CNN Sports Analyst Christine Brennan said. ""I think because Trump is so controversial and because the things he's saying and doing run counter to what many people believe ... athletes are finding their voice in a way that is reminiscent of the 1960s.""
Jacksonville Jaguars' Telvin Smith raises his fist during the National Anthem on September 25, 2016.
While Trump found some of his most vocal backers in the sports world -- he was endorsed by famous athletes and coaches, including legendary college basketball coach Bobby Knight and former All-Star pitcher Curt Shilling -- it is the opposition to Trump and the debates surrounding racism and women's rights that have revitalized activism in American sports.
A growing group of top tier athletes — from Super Bowl winners, basketball MVP's, boxing champions, ballet dancers, Olympic medalists in soccer, figure skating and fencing, and sports legends like Billie Jean King and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar — have formed a passionate chorus protesting the state of American politics.
Travel ban ignites fury
Since winning the election, Trump's travel ban on refugees and immigrants from seven majority Muslim countries, has escalated the backlash and drawn criticism from many corners of the sports world.
Fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, who made history in the 2016 Olympics as the first female Muslim American to win a medal for the United States and the first American to compete wearing a hijab, slammed Trump's ban on Tuesday, saying she has been discriminated against as a Muslim.
Ibtihaj Muhammad celebrates victory over Olena Kravatska of Ukraine during on Day 3 of the Rio 2016 Olympics.
""... Even though I represent Team USA and I have that Olympic hardware, it doesn't change how you look and how people perceive you,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, I know that people talk about this having a lot to do with these seven countries in particular, but I think the net is cast a little bit wider than we know. And I'm included in that as a Muslim woman who wears a hijab.""
CNN has reached out to the White House for comment and has not yet received a response.
Under Armour-sponsored athletes Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry and star ballet dancer Misty Copeland both took issue with CEO Kevin Plank this week for calling Trump a ""real asset"" to the United States.
Curry, who was not known for inserting himself into politics prior to 2016, publicly confronted the CEO of Under Armour Kevin Plank, saying, ""I agree with that description if you remove the 'et' from asset.""
Cleveland Cavaliers star forward Lebron James slammed Trump's travel ban last week, saying, it ""does not represent what the United States is about.""
And NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who formally endorsed Clinton, said the ban makes America ""a bad horror movie.""
Six New England Patriots players, including Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty, who protested racism on the field by raising their fists during the national anthem, announced that they will skip the team's upcoming White House visit, where they will be honored by Trump for winning this year's Super Bowl.

While not all six cited political reasons, some specifically pointed to their opposition to Trump.
""Basic reason for me is I don't feel accepted in the White House,"" McCourty said. ""With the President having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won't.""
Warriors head coach Steve Kerr and San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich both slammed Trump last month in what Brennan describes as ""absolutely the stuff of history.""
""I'm completely against what's happening. I think it's shocking. It's a horrible idea,"" Kerr said , reacting to news of the travel ban. ""I feel for all the people that are affected. Families are being torn apart, and I worry in the big picture what this means to the security of the world.""
""We as Muslims have to stand up to those who use Islam to advance their own personal agenda,"" Ali said in December. ""They have alienated many from learning about Islam. True Muslims know or should know that it goes against our religion to try and force Islam on anybody.""

Despite the backlash, others joined Kaepernick's protest, including his teammate Eric Reid, Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, Miami Dolphins players Arian Foster, Kenny Stills, Michael Thomas, Jelani Jenkins, Seattle Reign FC soccer star Megan Rapinoe and even some high school players
Kaepernick also faced criticism because he said there was no difference between voting for Trump or Clinton. He did not cast a ballot in 2016.
""It's reminiscent of back in the day when Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were influencing entire movements of people with the stances they were taking and their words,"" CNN Sports correspondent and former NFL player Coy Wire told CNN.

In the era of Martin Luther King Jr., when civil rights activists across America protested racial inequality, America saw a rise in activism that made its way into the world of sports.
One of the most notable examples is legendary boxer Ali's refusal to join the US armed forces and fight in the Vietnam war, citing his Muslim religion.
""How can you love Muhammad Ali and not love [Kaepernick] for the stance he took?"" Director Spike Lee told CNN in August.
""The same way John Carlos, Tommie Smith raised their black gloved fists in the '68 Olympics in Mexico. The same way Muhammad Ali refused to fight in the Vietnam War. These are rights that Americans have,"" he added.
US Olympic runners Tommie Smith and John Carlos bowed their heads and raised their fists during the national anthem to protest and despite having won gold and bronze medals, they were both suspended from the team.

Fist-raising is a symbol of solidarity and a symbol of the black power movement that dates back to the Black Panthers in the 60s and 70s.
And now, Smith is voicing his support for Kaepernick and others who are taking a stand.

""Back in 1968, ""danger"" was spelled the same way, felt the same way, and it could do the same harm to someone who's standing out by him or herself against the evolution in racism ... There is a sacrifice,"" he added.
'Black Lives Matter' echoes on the field
Even before Trump and Kaepernick, athletes had begun to make political statements on and off the field, particularly on police brutality, reflecting a broader cultural shift.
Wire said that the rise of social media and an evolution within sports organizations like the NFL and the NBA, where coaches and owners are ""more lenient"" on players speaking out, have encouraged more athletes to take a stand on social and politics issues.

""Back in the early 2000s, when I first came into the NFL it was 'do not talk about it, keep your head down.' Basically, 'just stick to sports, you're an athlete,' Wire said. ""But towards the end of my career it started to trend towards 'be smart, think before you click send on Twitter.'""
In an implicit reference to Kaepernick, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said last week that the organization encourages players to respect the flag but respects players who choose to exercise their First Amendment rights.
""We have to respect people's Constitutional rights, we understand that,"" Goodell said. ""But for us, we're all about patriotism.""
Five players from the St. Louis Rams walked onto the field at the start of a November 2014 game with their hands raised in the air in a ""don't shoot"" gesture to protest the police shooting death of unarmed Missouri teenager Michael Brown.

Members of the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Brooklyn Nets, including James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Garnett, wore ""I Can't Breathe"" T-shirts in December, reflecting the words of Eric Garner, who died after being placed into a chokehold by police.
At the time, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said that while he prefers that players comply with dress code rules, he respects their choice to speak out.
Silver reiterated this view in July, saying that while he didn't think it was a good idea for members of the Minnesota Lynx to wear ""Black Lives Matter"" shirts before a game, players in the NBA and the WNBA have a right to express their views.
""I would greatly prefer that the players use the platform they're given, social media, press conferences, media in locker rooms, however they want to do it, to make their political points of view be known,"" Silver said.
Silver also backed players, who took part in a July public forum with police officers and community members to discuss police brutality led by New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony.
And in an unprecedented move, the NBA moved next week's 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans, as a response to North Carolina's House Bill 2, more commonly know as the ""bathroom bill, which bans people from using public bathrooms that don't correspond to their biological sex as listed on their birth certificates.
Women's rights reverberate in locker rooms
Tennis legend Billie Jean King , who became a symbol for women's rights in the 60s, and retired soccer star Abby Wambach, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, campaigned for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
And figure skater Michelle Kwan, a five-time world champion, formally joined the Clinton campaign as an outreach coordinator, hoping to see the first woman president.

But when a 2005 hot mic video surfaced in October of Trump making derogatory remarks about women, the call for women's rights in the sports world became louder.
""When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything,"" Trump said in the 2005 tape.
Trump later apologized but dismissed his comments as ""locker room talk.""
Male and female athletes, from Lebron James , to figure skater Ashley Wagner slammed the notion that Trump's comments are just typical locker room banter.
""I believe through and through that any man who speaks in such a degrading way towards women is absolutely vile and disgusting,"" Wagner said in October.
A group of athletes, including James and other NBA players, joined hundreds of thousands at the Women's March last month to protest Trump.
Are Trump supporters afraid to speak out?
Some of Trump's most outspoken supporters have come from the sports world, including Knight, who appeared at campaign rallies with Trump and was a surrogate for him on talk shows.
But Wire said that some athletes who back Trump may be wary about speaking out.
""I definitely think its going to test some dynamics within certain teams and organizations,"" he said.
""Its not that I've experienced it personally, but I can put myself back in the cleats in the NFL locker room ... (Protests are) going to force us to look at our teammates and say 'that really means something to them,'"" he added.
Curt Schilling, who won three World Series, said last month that he's been ostracized due to his political views, claiming that his support for Trump has kept him out of the Baseball Hall of Fame.
""If I had said 'Lynch Trump,' I'd be getting in with about 90% of the vote,"" Schilling told TMZ last month.
Brennan said that while it's ""hard to know"" if some Trump supporters have kept quiet, ""if we are to judge from Curt Schilling's experiences and his opinion then perhaps that is the same.""
The New England Patriots, who won Super Bowl 51 last week, have been linked to Trump due to the President's friendship with quarterback Tom Brady.
What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017
But the five-time Super Bowl champ, who faced controversy during the 2016 election when a ""Make America Great Again"" hat was spotted in his locker, has been evasive when asked about Trump, keeping his comments non-political.
Trump announced a day before the general election that Brady and the team's coach Bill Belichick are supporting his campaign for president.
But the football star's wife, model Gisele Bundchen, bluntly denied those reports in a social media exchange.
""Gisele I head you and Tom were backing Trump! Is that true?"" an Instagram user asked.
""NO!"" Bundchen responded.
However, following Trump's win, the President said at a pre-inaugural dinner that Brady and Patriots owner Robert Kraft called to congratulate him.
While he did not deny it, Brady played down the claim during an interview, saying, ""I call a lot of people.""
""I have called him, yes, in the past,"" Brady said. ""Sometimes he calls me. Sometimes I call him. But, again, that's been someone I've known. I always try to keep it in context because for 16 years you know someone before maybe he was in the position that he was in. He's been very supportive of me for a long time. It's just a friendship.

ACTION PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK TODAY ...
WHAT ELSE IS NEW ON DAY 21 ...
IMMIGRATION
· Trump met with a bipartisan group of senators about Neil Gorsuch's Supreme Court nomination and indicated an openness to the so-called Gange of Eight reconvening to pursue a solution. The 2013 plan included a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, though spokesman Sean Spicer later clarified that Trump was not expressing support for that group's most recent failed effort, which included ""amnesty"" in his view.
· Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, the undocumented immigrant in Arizona who sparked protests after being taken into custody at her yearly immigration check-in, has been deported back to Mexico.
· Iowa Rep. Steve King, a prominent immigration hawk and early Trump supporter, said Wednesday that Trump should have repealed DACA on Day One.
· LeBron James may be Akron, Ohio's most famous export, but the NBA champ is far from the only person helping out his hometown. Here's a look at the crucial role that immigrant business owners and consumers have played in turning around this Rust Belt city.
· The Congressional Hispanic Caucus sent a letter to congressional leadership asking them to invite Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to address a Joint Session of Congress.
IMMIGRATION/TRADE
· In an effort to save the falling peso, Mexico raised its interested rates for the third time since the US election as part of its Trump ""contingency plan.""
Economic protests are sweeping through Mexico , some bad enough that they forced the US to temporarily close the border, but they are not about Trump -- they're a reaction to Mexico's rising gas prices, dubbed ""el gasolinazo.""
· Despite Trump's claim that NAFTA is a ""one-sided deal"" benefiting Mexico, the gains for our neighbor to the south have not been felt across all sectors of the Mexican economy.
OBAMACARE
· The Senate is set to confirm HHS Secretary nominee Tom Price on Friday. This development could speed up Republican moves on repealing and replacing Obamacare, as the administration has indicated his getting in place would be key to their efforts.
· California Rep. Tom McClintock is one of a growing number of GOP representatives facing backlash over repealing Obamacare at town halls. He went so far as to compare today's Democrats to those of the Civil War era.
· Anthem is appealing a federal judge's ruling that blocked its proposed acquisition of Cigna.
The Atlantic looks at why Republicans are slow-walking repealing and replacing Obamacare -- namely that their plans will likely lower costs for the young (who mostly vote Democratic) and increase costs for older blue-collar Americans, Trump's base.
TAXES/INFRASTRUCTURE -- Trump told leading American aviation CEOs that -- Trump told leading American aviation CEOs that he would not change the Open Skies Agreement that has allowed Qatari and UAE-based airlines to expand in the US market.
TAX CUTS -- In on-camera remarks ahead of his meeting with airline industry leaders, Trump said: ""Lowering the overall tax burden on American businesses big league, that's coming along very well.

568,"Story highlights Trump threw China relations into doubt after phone call with Taiwanese president
Taiwan says it will maintain close contact with US
US-China relations have long been governed by ""One China"" policy
(CNN) US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping spoke by phone Thursday evening, the first conversation between the two since Trump took office.
In the call, the two leaders discussed ""numerous topics,"" and Trump committed to honoring the ""One China"" policy at Xi's request, the White House said.
Since his election in November, President Trump has challenged Beijing over several issues and, most controversially, upended decades of diplomatic protocol by questioning longstanding American policy towards Taiwan.
China views Taiwan as a breakaway province and, since 1979, the US has acknowledged Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China, with US-China relations governed by the set of protocols known as the ""One China"" policy

569,"Washington (CNN) A group of Republican senators released a stern letter to President Donald Trump on Thursday calling for a ""tough-minded and principled policy"" toward Russia and urging that Trump ""should maintain the current US sanctions regime"" until Russian policy in Ukraine and Syria is changed.
The group also raised the controversial Russian hacking activities during the 2016 election.
""We must recognize and counter the active cyber and information warfare Russia is conducting, including attempted interference in our democratic elections process (with a) firm response,"" the letter said.
They further warned that the US ""should not enter into any military or diplomatic agreement with Russia regarding Syria's future"" until the Russian military ceases human rights abuses.
The group of seven Republican senators featured Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Sen. Joni Ernst Iowa, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a senior member of the GOP senate leadership.
Gardner told CNN's ""New Day"" on Thursday: ""It's important that we highlight the beliefs of many senators, our colleagues, across the national security committees -- that we do have certain lines that cannot be crossed when it comes to Russia.""
""We're sending a letter to the president saying look, this is where we have to stand on Russia,"" Gardner said. ""What they are doing in Ukraine is illegal and we can't lift sanctions on Russia until they stop their aggression and return Crimea. They've murdered 10,000 ... killed 10,000 Ukrainians. It's unacceptable. What they have done in Aleppo, what they have done in Syria, is unacceptable. Their activities on cyber around the globe are unacceptable, including in the United States this past year.""
He added: ""There is no quid pro quo there that can be given to Russian when it comes to, 'Hey, if you behave well over here, we can lift sanctions over here.' ""
The group's letter reflects unease among the foreign-policy and hawkish wings of the Republican Party, who have shared concerns over Trump's close embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his express desire to craft a more collaborative relationship between the two countries.
Those concerns were amplified when, in an interview on Sunday with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly , Trump responded to questions about Russian human rights abuses: ""You think our country is so innocent?""
Those opposed to Trump's Russian detente argue that the values and interests of the US and Russia are incompatible in some areas, such as the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, and that improved relations shouldn't come at their expense.
In the letter, the senators write that ""while we should seek common ground with Russian in the areas of mutual interest, we must never pursue cooperation with Russia at the expense of our fundamental interests of defending our allies and promoting our values.""
The senators also called out Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election -- a sensitive subject for Republicans, who have toed the line of acknowledging the Russian attempts to benefit Trump, while maintaining they had no effect on the outcome.
""The United States must have a firm response to this belligerent behavior from Moscow, which should include diplomatic actions, economic consequences, as well as a strengthened military posture in Europe,"" they said.
The group closed the letter urging Trump ""to relay to Moscow that the values of democracy, human rights, transparency, and accountability are central to US foreign policy,"" and that ""these values are non-negotiable.""
The letter follows another high-profile move by Republicans in Congress seeking to take a firmer line against Russian aggression in Eastern Europe. On Wednesday, a group led by Graham and Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin introduced legislation that would impose strict new congressional oversight and veto power over the Trump administration if it decided to lift sanctions on Russia.
The Russia Review Act would require the White House to submit a report detailing why it was seeking to lift sanctions, setting into motion a 120-day review period where Congress could vote to disapprove of easing the penalties on the country, according to a summary of the measure provided to CNN.
Sen. Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is cosponsoring the Graham-Cardin measure, along with Democratic Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Republican John McCain of Arizona.",positive
570,"(CNN) Rafael Shimunov was at home in Queens on January 28, when he got word that the protests outside the international arrivals terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport had begun to swell.
""I rushed out, didn't have any of my equipment, just my cell phone, and was there,"" he said 48 hours after his livestream of the demonstrations -- which eventually drew thousands and set off a taxi strike -- had been viewed 15 million times on Facebook. He spent the next day at the doctor, his hands numbed and bitten by the frigid winds off Jamaica Bay.
""You can look at the video or ask people and you'll see, immediately you saw a diversity in the types of people in the group,"" Shimunov said. ""It wasn't people I see at every rally. It wasn't people you would see at climate, it wasn't one age group or one income -- it was representative, so for every few people of a certain type, I saw hundreds and hundreds later. It just kept exploding.""
Shimunov, 38, was born in the former Soviet Union and came to the US as a child and a refugee in the early 1980s. Now he is the creative director for the Working Families Party, a small political organization with national ambitions and a growing northeastern power base.
In the two-and-a-half weeks since President Donald Trump's inauguration, an unrelenting wave of protests against the new administration -- and its early blitz of controversial executive actions -- has emboldened grassroots activists.
Just three months ago, these groups were cooking up more modest plans to hold a Clinton administration to its progressive promises. Now, with Trump in the White House, they view the Democratic establishment as ripe for the picking. Activists like Shimunov are focused on nurturing the new energy on the streets, translating blunt liberal outrage into a durable progressive mobilization.

Everyday people, protesting every day
There have been sparks before. But Shimunov believes this time around will be different. The usual suspects have been joined by novices. Protesting has become cool -- a woke alternative to Sunday brunch.
""I've been through Occupy, I've been in Black Lives Matter (events), and it seems that for regular, normal, everyday people, activism is becoming part of their routine,"" he said. ""A part of their lifestyle.""
For RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, the first national union to back Sanders in the primary, it is a question of necessity.
""The reality is heroes aren't made, they're cornered,"" she said. ""The millennials are increasing in number and frustration. They're the group that has not much to look forward to. They're going to continue to protest because they don't have anything to lose.""
The possibilities were put on tantalizing display during the Trump administration's chaotic opening weeks.
After millions turned out in Washington and around the country for the women's march protests on January 21, tens of thousands more crowded airports and city centers to rail against the White House travel ban the next weekend. In between and since, smaller, more tactical demonstrations have targeted Democratic officials seen to be going wobbly against Trump nominees during Senate confirmation hearings. On a frozen Tuesday night in Brooklyn, thousands of New Yorkers gathered on the streets outside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's home near Prospect Park to ask ""What the f---, Chuck?""
""Resist Trump Tuesdays"" are quickly becoming a staple of this charged moment. The most recent action saw hundreds of protesters outside Goldman Sachs headquarters in Manhattan. That followed a weekend ""LGBT Solidarity Rally"" at the Stonewall Inn, a National Historical Landmark and the venerated home of the early gay rights movement. Days earlier, Yemeni bodega owners went on strike , closing their groceries for eight hours on a weekday in defiance of Trump's travel ban.
In conservative California and Florida districts this weekend, throngs of demonstrators angrily confronted GOP congressmen who have vowed and voted to repeal Obamacare. Out west, Rep. Tom McClintock left an event with a security escort as protesters chanted ""Shame on you!"" Florida Rep. Gus Bilirakis faced tough questions in a scene, captured on video, that echoed the contentious meetings faced by Democrats in 2009 when they went home to sell voters on President Barack Obama's healthcare plan.
""These are people who are getting engaged in protests for the first time,"" Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said last week. ""It's really the white blood cells of democracy attacking unconstitutional actions and a fairly illegitimate president.""
Activists organizations like PCCC spend years building out email lists, raising money and slowly staking out influence in a dynamic political economy, where success on the national level -- in this case, two terms of Obama -- can open one door while closing thousands more. After a decade of Democratic control in Washington, rank-and-file liberals had mostly retreated from the activist community.

""Some organizations would have it be the highlight of their year if people showed up at events across the country in response to months of planning,"" Green said. ""And here it happens within a couple hours, organically.""
Taking on Trump -- and the Democrats
Translating that raw energy into dedicated political action, while sustaining what can be a mentally and physically draining protest campaign against an aggressive administration, has been a unique and unexpected challenge. Establishment Democrats were slow to the draw. Some, like Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, have been dismissive, urging partisans to ""take a chill pill"" and proceed with surgical focus on vulnerable GOP officeholders. Others are interested but anxious, concerned that embracing the left will alienate moderate voters.
But there is little appetite for half-measures among the vanguard of the protest movement. Their logic is simple: The Clinton campaign -- and elected Democrats more broadly -- preached pragmatism during most of Obama's time in office and throughout 2016. And for that, they lost. Trump's victory has created pain -- but also an opening.
""This is not just the beginning of the 'tea party of the left' but a larger movement for civil rights that could make history,"" said Moumita Ahmed, founder of ""Millennials for Revolution,"" an offspring of the Sanders campaign. ""The steady flow of protests will absolutely continue and get bigger and bigger.""
Protesters hold signs during a demonstration against the immigration ban imposed by President Donald Trump at Los Angeles International Airport on January 29, 2017 in Los Angeles, California.
Progressive strategist Rebecca Katz, a former special adviser to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and top aide to former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, is optimistic that the protests will solidify and operate simultaneously as a bulwark against Trump and political engine room for wise Democrats.
""This is a movement that has been building for a while. No one is getting tired. We are only going to get more determined and have more people join us,"" she said. ""You saw it in Washington, but it wasn't just the women who were marching in Washington -- it was the women who were marching around the country. In every state, in the reddest of congressional districts. And they were saying we demand more: stand up for us.""
Building solidarity, rebuilding a party
The promise of Occupy Wall Street, a resounding but brief response to the financial crisis -- along with the successes of the ""Fight for $15"" minimum wage campaign, the rise of Black Lives Matter and the thundering coalition of resistance that backstopped the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in their fight to block the Dakota Access Pipeline -- has led activists into the Trump era with a heightened awareness of the opportunities -- and challenges -- up ahead.

""Since Occupy, people talk almost routinely about the 99% and the 1%. I think that did help launch a populist movement in America,"" said Larry Cohen, board chairman of Our Revolution, the organization formed by Sanders after his campaign ended. ""January 21st, with millions of women marching around the world, particularly in this country, was similar -- a gigantic scaling up of what people could imagine. So you're always going to see big moments. The question is can we build big movements?""
""Part of the winning,"" Cohen added, ""has got to be about addressing, in a much deeper way, the economic issues that we face and not just talk about continuity from the Obama years.""
Clinton voters on that point will go a long way toward determining the movement's longevity and whether a party How the progressive left, now led by Sanders allies, is (or is not) able to engage more moderateClinton voters on that point will go a long way toward determining the movement's longevity and whether a party still riven by the primary campaign can rebuild and rebound. In the run-up to the Women's March on Washington, organizers huddled repeatedly, spending hours debating, editing and eventually crafting a mission statement that took care to acknowledge dozens of groups with diverging interests.
The race to take over the Democratic National Committee chair has been optimistic but anxious , with the front-runners tap dancing carefully around the party's fissures. Tom Perez, the former Obama administration labor secretary, has the establishment juice, but Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison is the Berniecrat favorite. The vote is only weeks away, but the winner will inherit a party still facing fundamental questions about its path forward.

Those divisions are bound to clash with new alliances forming on the streets, which will be tested as the 2018 midterm elections near. For now, though, organizers are betting that opposition to the Trump agenda serve as a tie to bind what they describe as overlapping or intersectional interests.
""I think there will be subsets that will peel off. You'll peel off subsets with tax (cuts),"" the NNU's DeMoro said. ""But for the most part, the average person who is involved in the protests -- I don't think they have a choice.""",positive

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told a bipartisan group of senators at the White House Thursday that he is interested in learning more about the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" immigration reform bill, multiple meeting attendees told CNN.
Backing a comprehensive immigration reform bill like the one pushed by a bipartisan group of senators in 2013 would be a dramatic break from what Trump said during his 2016 campaign. The President made the comment Thursday as he urged the group to work together to figure out a solution to break gridlock on immigration.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer quickly knocked down speculation that Trump was supportive of a bill like the one supported by the Gang of Eight, which would have created a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants as long as certain border security measures were undertaken at the same time. But those in the room said Trump did not dismiss the measure and encouraged bipartisan work on immigration.
Senators, according to one attendee, told Trump that it was important to fix the nation's immigration system and stressed that Trump was in a ""unique position to help do that.""
""He encouraged us to review it,"" West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said referring to the 2013 bill.

572,"Story highlights Pennsylvania state Sen. Daylin Leach was upset by a Trump comment
""Senator Leach is mad as hell about it,"" Leach spokesman says
(CNN) President Trump is known for firing off barbed tweets.
Now a Pennsylvania state legislator is using social media to attack the nation's chief executive, speaking to him directly and calling Trump a ""fascist, loofa-faced, s***-gibbon!"" on Twitter and Facebook.
Nope. Leach's outburst was inspired by a Politico article about a meeting Trump recently had with sheriffs from around the nation and a conversation during that meeting about asset forfeiture. That's a legal practice in which a law enforcement agency seizes money and property that may have been obtained through criminal activities.
According to the article, Rockwall County, Texas, Sheriff Harold Eavenson mentioned that a state senator in Texas wanted to change the asset forfeiture law. The change would require that a person be convicted of a crime before his or her assets could be seized.

""It's a shame what's been happening to our great, truly great law enforcement officers,"" Trump said
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump signed three new executive orders Thursday that he said are ""designed to restore safety in America.""
Trump signed the executive orders in the Oval Office after swearing in Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
One of the orders, aimed at ""reduc(ing) crime and restor(ing) public safety,"" directs Sessions to establish a new Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety.
The Task Force will develop ""strategies to reduce crime, including, in particular, illegal immigration, drug trafficking and violent crime,"" propose new legislation, and submit at least one report to the President within the next year.
A second executive order, aimed at combating transnational drug cartels, prescribes steps for various federal agencies to ""increase intelligence"" sharing among law enforcement partners. The order also instructs an existing inter-agency working group to submit a report to Trump within four months detailing the progress made in combating criminal organizations, ""along with any recommended actions for dismantling them.""

Putin to travel to China in May, analysts say Trump may join him
Hong Kong (CNN) US President Donald Trump has written to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, according to the White House, the first contact the two leaders have had since Xi sent a congratulatory note for the inauguration.
Trump sent a letter to President Xi Wednesday wishing him a prosperous Year of the Rooster and saying he looks forward to developing ""a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China,"" press secretary Sean Spicer said.
The two leaders have yet to speak by phone.
Trump had previously been criticized by some Chinese commentators for not recording a Lunar New Year message, although his daughter and granddaughter did attend a celebration at the Chinese embassy in Washington.
Since his election, Trump has challenged Beijing over a range of issues -- slamming its military build-up in the South China Sea, its currency and trade policies and, perhaps most controversially, upending decades of diplomatic protocol by questioning a longstanding US policy towards Taiwan.",positive
578,"Washington (CNN) The visit to Washington Friday by Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe will be the second time President Donald Trump has sat down with the Japanese leader. The first was in November at Trump Tower, just 10 days after Trump's win and before he took the oath of office.
But it will be a first for Abe's wife, Akie, and first lady Melania Trump, who would traditionally play hostess to the spouse of the foreign leader, though the White House has yet to confirm if this will be the case.
Late Thursday night, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tweeted that Melania Trump would welcome the Abes to Washington, but did not elaborate.

Complaint to DoJ comes after Trump attacked judge who halted travel ban
(CNN) A group of lawyers have written a letter to the heads of the Department of Justice to complain about the President's attacks on the judiciary.
Appellate lawyers from across the country wrote the letter to Acting Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Acting Attorney General Dana Boente complaining about the attacks, including a Twitter tirade against a judge who temporarily blocked one of Trump's executive orders.
The letter says that it is acting on the behalf of judges, who the signatories say can't respond to Trump's attacks as they are prevented from speaking out publicly due to ethical constraints.
This letter, first reported by law blog Above the Law , is signed by 145 attorneys who maintain federal practices or have served as federal law clerks.

580,"Story highlights ""All he had to do was sign an executive order on the first day. That should've been done,"" King said.
""Knock it out and let's get on with life,"" he added.
(CNN) Republican Congressman Steve King said Wednesday that President Donald Trump should have repealed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), on his first day in office.
Enacted by President Barack Obama, DACA shields undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children from deportation and makes them eligible for driver's licenses and work permits. Trump pledged to repeal the program during his presidential campaign, but has not yet taken action on it.
King, who holds one of the most hardline stances on immigration of any Republican in the House, criticized the new presidential administration's inaction on the "" Larry O'Connor Show"" on WMAL Washington, DC, radio.
""Listen, the President made a clear pledge,"" the Iowa congressman said. ""This was actually going to be first day. But from the first day on, information is that they continue to issue DACA permits to US citizenship and immigration services. That's roughly 800 a day. All he had to do was sign an executive order on the first day. That should've been done. I timed him: He was signing executive orders, it was taking him 47 seconds per executive order a Saturday or two ago. I only want 47 seconds of the President's time. Knock it out and let's get on with life.""
Earlier in his answer, King said that he was ""wary"" of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus' views on immigration because of the position he took as chairman of the Republican National Committee. He cited the RNC's ""autopsy"" of Mitt Romney's 2012 loss and Priebus' subsequent support for immigration reform that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship.

581,"Washington (CNN) Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to President Donald Trump, was ""counseled"" after promoting Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessory brand during an interview from the White House Thursday morning, as members of both parties are now calling for a review of whether the comments broke government rules.
Conway, in a Fox News interview from the White House, urged people to ""go buy Ivanka's stuff.""
""Go buy Ivanka's stuff, is what I would tell you,"" Conway said. ""It's a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully -- I'm going to just, I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.""
The comments could run afoul with federal law that bars public employees from making an ""endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity.""
The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland joined with Republican Chairman Jason Chaffetz to refer Conway to the government ethics watchdog office for potentially breaking rules barring government employees from endorsing private businesses.
""We request you review Conway's statements and act primptly on the basis of your findings,"" the two jointly wrote in a letter to the US Office of Government Ethics.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer said during his daily briefing: ""Kellyanne has been counseled. ... She's been counseled on that subject.""
The White House counsel's office talked to Conway, not long after her appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" an official told CNN. The counsel's office informed her that what she said on television was at odds with ethical guidelines. The official said Conway did not push back, acknowledging her misstep.
In an appearance on Fox News Thursday evening, Conway said she spoke with the President and believes he supports her despite the potential ethics violation. She also said she was ""aware"" of the letter from the oversight committee.
""I spent a lot of time with the President of the United States this afternoon, and he supports me 100%,"" Conway said.
The incident could spark a broader discussion inside the West Wing about conflicts of interest, the official said. White House counsel Don McGhan is in the process of making sure everyone is clear about rules and the law.
Cummings pointed to the comments, writing to Chaffetz, R-Utah, ""this appears to be a textbook violation of government ethics laws and regulations enacted to prevent the abuse of an employee's government position.""
The Maryland Democrat cited federal statutes, an executive order signed by President George W. Bush and regulations put out by the Office Government Ethics that prohibit using public office for personal gain.
Cummings argued that since the oversight panel has jurisdiction over laws addressing White House employees it should make the referral.
A spokeswoman for Cummings told CNN that the Maryland Democrat spoke by phone with Chaffetz and that they are drafting a joint letter to the Office of Government Ethics asking what penalty it would recommend for Conway.
In an interview Thursday afternoon with CNN's Jake Tapper, Sen. Cory Booker said, Conway ""clearly broke the law.""
He tied the incident into a broader criticism of Trump's businesses, which he said remained a major cause for concern and caused the President to violate the Emoluments clause of the Constitution.
Different government agencies have different penalties for rules violations for employees using public office for private gain, with some imposing a five-day suspension to removal, and others recommending a two week suspension to removal for the offense.
It's the latest in a string of ethics concerns raised about the Trump administration's relationship with the family's private businesses since he assumed office.
Spicer did not outline what he meant by Conway being ""counseled.""
When pressed for details, Spicer simply said: ""That's it.""",neutral
582,"Washington (CNN) The nation's former spy chief said he worries the Trump administration's recent travel ban targeting citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries is damaging to US interests and that he's not aware of any intelligence necessitating the ban.
James Clapper, who served as director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama, made his first public comments since leaving office during an exclusive interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto.
""I do worry (the) countries in question with whom we do deal and who are reliable partners, and I also worry about this creating a recruiting tool for the extremists,"" Clapper said, ""that they will point to this proof that there is a war on all Muslims and they are very astute, particularly ISIL, at exploiting for recruitment purposes.""
Trump issued an executive order last month that temporarily banned people from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya from entering the country until more stringent safeguards and vetting standards for entry could be implemented.
Clapper said while the vetting being done on people entering the country was not ""perfect,"" those actions were strong enough to keep the country safe without this new measure.
Clapper, while noting that he's farther removed from the job each day that goes by, said ""I don't believe we, in (the intelligence community), were aware of any extraordinary threats that we weren't already dealing with.""
He added, ""We were using some very rigorous vetting processes to check people, validate the people were who they claim to be.""
In his first public comments on the matter, Clapper said the decision to brief both Trump, who was still the President-elect at the time, and Obama on a dossier alleging Russia had compromising information on Trump was partly due to various media outlets and offices on Capitol Hill having the document.
""We thought it was important that he know about it,"" Clapper said of Trump. ""That was the main point. Not to comment on the veracity"" of the information.
In the days following the revelation of the document, first reported by CNN, Trump publicly criticized the intelligence community. He went so far as to compare it to Nazi Germany -- which eventually prompted a phone call from Clapper to Trump.
Clapper said he was ""concerned"" about the comparison and said the comments made many in the intelligence community ""quite upset.""
""I felt obliged to call the President-elect and appeal to his higher instincts, and to make sure he understood what our ... motives were."" He said that the intelligence community's aim is to ""support to the commander in chief, and to keep him as informed as possible, particularly if it involved some jeopardy to him.""
Clapper said Trump was ""very affable and solicitous"" in the call and characterized the discussion as a ""success,"" noting that it was a ""constructive engagement.""
When Trump visited the CIA the day after his inauguration, Clapper was concerned once again.
""For a couple minutes, it was fine. I actually, I was encouraged when I heard that his first visit after the election was going to be the CIA,"" the former director said. But then his comments devolved into politics.
Clapper emphasized the importance of the wall for fallen intelligence members that the President stood in front of as ""hallowed space, not only for CIA people, but actually for the entire intelligence community.""
He added, ""I would hope that when people stand in front of edifices like that, that they remember that.""
In the wake of the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was behind cyber efforts intended to affect the outcome of the US presidential election, Clapper said Russia still posed a clear threat to the United States.
""I'm sure they've continued"" with the hacking, even after intelligence agencies released a report detailing their alleged breaches, he assessed. ""I think it's in their DNA, whether during the Soviet Era or now.""
And what about possible Russian attempts to interfere in the 2018 midterm or 2020 presidential election?
""I certainly wouldn't put it past them. If they thought it would be to their advantage to influence a national election or a congressional election, they would,"" Clapper said.
Clapper, a retired Air Force intelligence officer who served under every president since John F. Kennedy, said there were a range of emotions he experienced when he left office last month.
""I think the overriding feeling I had at 12:01 a.m. on the 20th of January was a sense of relief,"" he said.
While he is ""quite anxious"" for Sen. Dan Coats to be confirmed to succeed him, Clapper said there is still a sense of apprehension that hangs over him.
""Well, I worry,"" he said. ""I have a lot personally invested in the US intelligence community. It's been a 50-year passion of mine ... so I have a lot invested in it, and yes, I do worry about it.""",negative
583,"(CNN) Let's be real -- Washington isn't exactly a destination for celebrity sightings. But the shared hobby of the District's most high-profile women, Michelle Obama and Ivanka Trump, has local indoor cycling studios abuzz.
Washington's boutique indoor cyclers fall into two distinct camps, with minimal overlap: SoulCycle and Flywheel.
SoulCycle is a candlelit spin workout with dance moves aboard the bike and an emphasis on mantra. Flywheel features stadium seating with a technology component that tracks metrics and allows cyclers to compete for points based on speed and resistance. (Full disclosure: this writer is an unlimited monthly member at Flywheel.)
Both studios charge around $30 a class, which are typically 45 minutes long. Another thing both studios have in common: a no cell phone policy, a rare and welcome sight amid tech-obsessed Washingtonians.
And as the new administration settles in and tensions run high after a bruising 2016 campaign, Flywheel has taken further steps to keep politics out of the studio.
Flywheel founder Ruth Zukerman, who was also a co-founder of SoulCycle, sent her team of instructors an email last week on the topic.
""I wanted to reinforce that ... probably in DC more than ever, people need to have that break from everything that's going on in the world,"" she said, describing an email she sent to instructors.
That said, the political will sometimes find its way into class.

Stylistically, Flywheel is the conservative workout, SoulCycle, the liberal -- the former focused on individual merits, the latter, on a collective mantra.
And while the founders of both studios are all registered Democrats, per public records, Republicans, Democrats and reporters alike can be seen on bikes across the District. Some operatives even have been known to grace the instructor seat.
In 2016, the Clinton campaign held a fundraiser at SoulCycle's TriBeCa location, attended by Chelsea Clinton. The fundraiser was originally billed as a $2,700-a-head event, but with about 60 seats to fill, some attendees were able to snag tickets at the last minute for $50. (Flywheel does charity rides, primarily focused on health causes like breast cancer and heart disease. ""We want to treat everybody equally, but from a brand standpoint, with philanthropy, political probably isn't a good avenue,"" Jake Spitz, Flywheel vice president of business development, said.)
SoulCycle did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

Former first lady and workout guru Michelle Obama was herself in camp SoulCycle during her time in the White House, and was often spotted by star-struck Washingtonians coming and going from class. She has arranged her own private sessions outside normal class hours.
Unsurprisingly, the attendance of such high-profile clientele can be a big boost for boutique workout facilities. Michelle Obama was also an early advocate for DC's [solidcore] studios, which has been ranked as one of the toughest workouts in the city -- and probably one of the priciest, at $37 per class. (Ivanka Trump also recently went to a [solidcore] class under an alias -- and founder Anne Mahlum posted about it publicly on Facebook, saying she's reached out to ask her for a meeting.
Mahlum later told CNN some of her clients have ""already been adversely impacted"" by the President's policies and said she welcomes ""the opportunity to open up the communication channels"" with Ivanka Trump.
""There's no question,"" that celebrity sightings add value to the brand, Zukerman said, noting such high-profile clients as Sting (who ""literally comes almost every day""), Ashley Olsen and Jennifer Lawrence. ""There's been an excitement when the whole stadium of people see the celebrities or when after class and Sting takes his shirt off in the waiting area, that causes a lot of attention.""
Ivanka Trump -- Flywheel
First daughter Ivanka Trump is a brand-loyal early adopter -- tweeting about Flywheel as early as July 2010, months after its first studio opened in New York.
""At that point in time, truthfully, Ivanka wasn't totally a celebrity,"" Spitz said. Katie Couric, Kyra Sedgwick, and Jimmy Fallon were frequenting their studios around that time, and Trump was part of a group of New York socialites who worked out at their studio in the Hamptons that summer.
She's tweeted about the workout at least six times, and has been spotted stopping by the Dupont Circle studio for a late afternoon ride multiple times. (Secret Service was present, but didn't clip in the cycling shoes.)

The feeling is mutual: Flywheel congratulated Trump on her pregnancy with daughter, Arabella, now 5, in a January 2011 Facebook post
And Trump's competitive streak is well-suited to the Flywheel method. Each studio has a Torqboard, a display that ranks class riders based on their points.
While most riders ride under pseudonyms or avoid the leaderboard altogether (""FckTrump,"" ""BadHombre,"" and ""BadDude"" were spotted in recent classes at a DC studio), Trump confidently rides as simply ""Ivanka.""
""In the Trump household, it was never just about meeting the expectations of others. It was about exceeding them. It was about surprising people. And being the best,"" she wrote in her 2009 book.

The US Office of Special Counsel said this week it has been flooded with questions about Trump
Washington (CNN) Federal employees who want to hang their favorite picture of President Donald Trump in their office can feel free to do so -- for now.
That's according to new guidance from the US Office of Special Counsel, which said this week it had been flooded with questions from employees curious about how much they can speak out about Trump.
Bureaucrats are in violation of the Hatch Act if they start calling for the re-election or defeat of a candidate, and Trump has already signaled to the Federal Election Commission that he plans to run for re-election in 2020, OSC said in a memo this week
""Because the 2020 election is still more than three years away, at this time not all expressions of support or opposition to President Trump constitute political activity for purposes of the Hatch Act,"" the memo said. ""However, the Hatch Act does prohibit federal employees, while on duty or in the workplace, from expressly advocating for or against his re-election in 2020.""
Employees may hang any photograph of Trump in their office or even memorabilia from his 2016 campaign, the guidance said. But anything relating to the 2020 campaign -- say a ""Re-elect Trump in 2020"" sign or post on social media -- is off limits.

585,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's advisers are back in a familiar role: playing cleanup after a tweet from their boss.
With one tweet early Thursday morning, Trump complicated any attempt Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch might have been making to build support among Senate Democrats who will be crucial to his confirmation.
In a series of meetings on Wednesday, senators said Gorsuch told them he found Trump's recent tweets critical of the judiciary ""disheartening"" and ""demoralizing.""
Trump has said Gorsuch's words were ""misrepresented,"" and his aides have argued the nominee was not speaking specifically about Trump's recent criticism of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled against the Justice Department Thursday night in deciding not to reinstate the President's travel ban.
""There is no doubt in my mind that he was referring to these attacks,"" Connecticut Democratic Sen.

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump hosted a bipartisan group of senators for lunch Thursday at the White House to discuss their potential support for Neil Gorsuch, the President's Supreme Court pick.
The meeting was an attempt by Trump to smooth the way for Gorsuch's confirmation, but his attempt may have been colored by his continued criticism of Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal.
Blumenthal said Wednesday that Gorsuch told him he found Trump's previous attack on a federal judge ""disheartening"" and ""demoralizing."" Trump responded early Thursday morning saying it was Blumenthal who was wrong about what Gorsuch said.
Trump repeated that claim even as he was seated with five members of the Senate's Democratic caucus.
""His comments were misrepresented and what you should do is ask Sen. Blumenthal about his Vietnam record that didn't exist,"" Trump said at the beginning of a meeting, referring to the fact that the Connecticut Democrat was forced to apologize in 2010 for saying he served in Vietnam, when he only served during the Vietnam era.

587,"Washington (CNN) Updated at 3:20 p.m.: White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday Trump ""absolutely"" stands by his selection of Gorsuch.
President Donald Trump falsely accused a Democratic senator Thursday of misrepresenting his Supreme Court nominee's words, according to several familiar with the incident.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday that Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's nominee, told him he found Trump's attack on a federal judge on Twitter ""disheartening"" and ""demoralizing.""
Within a half-hour, Gorsuch spokesman Ron Bonjean, who was tapped by the White House to head communications for Gorsuch, confirmed that the nominee, Gorsuch, used those words in his meeting with Blumenthal. Several other senators, including Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, later relayed similar accounts of Gorsuch forcefully criticizing Trump's public attacks on the judiciary branch.
And on Thursday, Blumenthal said on MSNBC Gorsuch specifically told him he ""should feel free to mention what I said about these attacks being disheartening and demoralizing.""
But none of that stopped Trump from firing off a shot against Blumenthal -- and at the same time raising questions about the coherence of the White House's messaging.

Gorsuch's criticism came in response to Trump's recent criticism of federal judges who have ruled against his immigration ban or appear poised to do so, in particular in reference to one of the President's tweets slamming one of those judges as a ""so-called judge.""
""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"" Trump tweeted last Saturday.
But White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday Trump ""absolutely"" stands by his selection of Gorsuch, as well his own past comments about the federal judges who are hearing arguments over the legality of his immigration executive order.
""No, the President doesn't have any regrets,"" Spicer said during his daily press briefing.
""He has no regrets,"" Spicer repeated, saying that Gorsuch's remarks weren't referring to any specific federal judge or court.
Bonjean had confirmed Gorsuch called Trump's tweet about the ""so-called judge"" ""disheartening"" and ""demoralizing"" in his conversation with Blumenthal.
Blumenthal, meanwhile, stood by his accounting of Gorsuch's comments, telling CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" Thursday morning he ""absolutely and accurately"" stated what Gorsuch told him.
""I think that the President needs to hear from Judge Gorsuch about exactly what he is saying to myself and Senate colleagues,"" Blumenthal said. ""Maybe he simply hasn't been informed and that's the reason for his tweet.""
Former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is helping shepherd Gorsuch's nomination on the Hill said in a statement Thursday Gorsuch has told senators ""he finds any criticism of a judge's integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.""
Ayotte added the judge has made clear he ""could not comment on any specific cases and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters.""
Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska also confirmed Thursday that Gorsuch criticized Trump's attacks on the federal judge in a meeting with him as well.
Sasse said Gorsuch ""got pretty passionate"" about the topic, particularly when he asked Gorsuch about Trump's ""so-called judge"" tweet.
""This is a guy who welled up with some energy. He said any attack on any brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges. He believes in an an independent judiciary,"" Sasse said Thursday morning on MSNBC.
Military service
Trump's dig at Blumenthal's military service is a reference to Blumenthal's past misrepresentations about his service during the Vietnam era.
Blumenthal obtained multiple military deferments to avoid getting drafted into the Vietnam War and ultimately landed in the Marine Corps Reserve and never deployed to Vietnam, though he claimed multiple times he had served in Vietnam. Blumenthal apologized for misrepresenting his service in 2010.
While Blumenthal enlisted in the Marine Reserve after multiple deferments, Trump -- who was also eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War -- never enlisted, instead obtaining multiple student deferments and ultimately a medical deferment for a bone spur to avoid the military draft.

588,"Washington (CNN) When he wanted to dispute a Democratic Senator over his Supreme Court nominee, President Donald Trump went after the senator's misstatements about serving in Vietnam. And as he defends the first military mission he approved, Trump, who did not himself serve in the military or Vietnam, is again tangling with fellow Republican John McCain, a decorated Vietnam veteran and former POW.
The decision to take on veterans could put Trump on shaky ground: The President never served in the military and received student and health deferments that kept him out of serving in the war.
In a string of tweets on Thursday morning, Trump took on McCain for suggesting his first military action -- a raid in Yemen that netted intelligence against ISIS, but cost the lives Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ""Ryan"" Owens and a number of Yemeni civilians -- was not a success . Trump also lashed out against Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who told reporters on Wednesday that Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court pick, told him that he felt Trump's comments about the judiciary branch were ""demoralizing"" and ""disheartening.""
Trump's tweets appear to be an attempt to quiet dissent, even from those within his party.
McCain, who was shot down over Hanoi in 1967 and was held as a prisoner of war until 1973, questioned Trump's raid earlier this week, suggesting that the White House should not have called in a ""success"" because Chief Petty Officer William ""Ryan"" Owens was killed.
This file picture taken in 1967 shows US Navy Lt. Cmdr. John McCain lying on a bed in a Hanoi hospital as he was being given medical care for his injuries.
""While many of the objectives of the recent raid in Yemen were met, I would not describe any operation that results in the loss of American life as a success,"" McCain said in a statement.
That drew the ire of Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary, who said Wednesday that ""anyone who would suggest it's not a success does a disservice to the life of Chief Ryan Owens."" Spicer went on to say those questioning the raid should apologize.
Trump, who once dismissed McCain's time as a POW, saying "" I like people who weren't captured "", hit McCain on Twitter over the Yemen raid.

McCain's daughter -- Meghan -- slammed Trump for his comments about her father, noting that the President ""has never served.""
Trump has never served. My father can't bend one of his knees or lift one of his arms above his head. I am done with this today. DONE. — Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) February 9, 2017

""Trump has never served. My father can't bend one of his knees or lift one of his arms above his head. I am done with this today. DONE. Disagree with politics ANY single day but how dare anyone question the honor of my father and his service,"" she tweeted.
There is another problem for Trump suggesting that questioning the success of a military raid is out of bounds: He routinely questioned the wisdom of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during the 2016 campaign, despite once saying he was in favor of going into Iraq.
""I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East,"" Trump said during a debate in August 2015. ""And I'm the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it. And that's exactly what happened.""
Trump, however, said in 2002 on a radio show that he was in favor of invading Iraq.
Trump's comments about McCain came after Blumenthal told reporters that Gorsuch said during a meeting that Trump's tweets about the judiciary were ""demoralizing"" and ""disheartening.""

Ron Bonjean, who is leading communications for Gorsuch during the confirmation process, later confirmed the comments happened.
All of this clearly irked Trump, who on Thursday morning laid into Blumenthal not over Gorsuch, but rather over an old controversy surrounding Blumenthal's accounts of his own military service.

Blumenthal admitted in a 2010 New York Time story to misrepresenting his military service after saying that it had been ""in"" Vietnam. Blumenthal served Marine Reserves in Washington, not actually in Vietnam.
""I have misspoken about my service, and I regret that, and I take full responsibility,"" Blumenthal said in 2010.
Despite his own deferments, Trump remained unrepentant, refusing to apologize for his jibe against McCain in 2015.
Spicer, then a top strategist at the Republican National Committee, knocked Trump for suggesting McCain was not a hero.
.@SenJohnMcCain is an American hero because he served his country and sacrificed more than most can imagine. Period. — Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) July 18, 2015
As a teenager, Trump attended the private New York Military Academy, but he moved on to a business career afterward. The New York Times reported last Trump sought and received five military draft deferments during the Vietnam War, including one medical deferment after was diagnosed with bone spurs in his foot.
While Trump said in interviews at the time that he ""regretted not serving in many ways,"" he has also made light of service.
""It is a dangerous world out there — it's scary, like Vietnam,"" Trump said about contracting sexually transmitted diseases during a 1997 interview with Howard Stern. ""Sort of like the Vietnam era. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier.""

589,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump, concerned his travel ban could be stopped cold in the judicial branch after a less-than-stellar rollout, is leaning into fear, attempting to ratchet up terror concerns by telling audiences that he has learned considerably more about terror since taking office last month.
Trump and his top aides are well aware that his travel ban would benefit from public approval, so Trump made the case Wednesday that he knows more about terrorism than most. He suggested that Americans -- at least those who don't get classified briefings -- don't understand the terror threat against the United States.
""Terrorism is a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand,"" Trump told a gathering of sheriffs in a Washington hotel.
Seemingly hinting at information gleaned from his classified briefings, the President added: ""Believe me. I've learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.""
Ari Fleischer, who served as Bush's White House press secretary during 9/11, said all presidents use ""realistic, worse-case scenarios"" to push their agendas.
He cautioned the tactic could be abused and result in undermining an administration.
""Like anything, you can go too far. You can exaggerate, you can get facts wrong, you can hype it to a degree where you lose credibility,"" he said. ""But it is been a time honored tradition in American politics to use a worst-case scenario to drive an agenda.""
JUST WATCHED Appeals court weighs Trump's travel ban Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Appeals court weighs Trump's travel ban 02:12
It's also a tactic that's worked for Trump. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump urged his supporters to worry about terror and pushed them to do so by painting the world as an increasingly dangerous place.
""People are scared,"" Trump said in his June Republican National Convention acceptance speech. ""The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.""
More Americans said terrorism was a pressing concern in 2016 than any point since 2003.
According to a CNN poll released in 2016, 71% of Americans said further acts of terrorism are very or somewhat likely in the United States over the next several weeks, a number that has not been that high since March 2003.
The strategy
Trump's strategy as President is twofold.
Alarmist language could help sell the travel ban to a skeptical public.
Trump is also suggesting he knows more about the need for the ban than the judges overseeing the legal challenges, who are not privy to confidential briefings.
Americans are largely split on Trump's executive order, which bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
Voters generally disapprove of key aspects of Trump's order, according to a Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday . It found 51% of the public oppose suspending travel to the US for 90 days from seven countries, 60% oppose suspending all refugee immigration for 120 days and 70% oppose indefinitely suspending the Syrian refugee program.
Trump's order went before a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals three-judge panel on Tuesday where lawyers from Trump's Justice Department squared up against the states of Washington and Minnesota. The court is expected to rule on Trump's order by the end of the week.
JUST WATCHED Judges grill lawyers during travel ban hearing Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Judges grill lawyers during travel ban hearing 02:45
The President knocked the arguments against his travel ban Wednesday, telling the same group of sheriffs that ""even a 'bad high school student' "" could understand the language of his order and find in his favor.
Words of reassurance
In contrast, after high-profile attacks in San Bernardino and Paris, President Barack Obama said: ""the threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it.""
""Let's be vigilant, but not afraid,"" Obama said in his final speech as President. ""(ISIS) will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight.""
Even George W. Bush, whose administration did, at times, stoke fear in the run up to the Iraq War and around homeland security, was measured in the face of the 9/11 attacks.
""Now, the American people have got to go about their business. We cannot let the terrorists achieve the objective of frightening our nation to the point where we don't conduct business, where people don't shop,"" Bush said after 9/11, the deadliest terrorist attack in US history.
Bush, in his final speech as president, said the United States was a nation ""that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom.""
""This is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger, and compassion in the face of suffering,"" he said.
A good example of Bush using fear: His push to establish the Department of Homeland Security in 2003.
At the time, Fleischer said, Bush would regularly read his morning ""threat matrix"" -- a document about produced by the Department of Homeland Security on possible threats -- and use it publicly at times to push his plan to fight terrorism.
""With a vast nation to defend, we can neither predict nor prevent every conceivable attack,"" Bush said before establishing the new government agency. ""And in a free and open society, no department of government can completely guarantee our safety against ruthless killers, who move and plot in shadows. Yet our government will take every possible measure to safeguard our country and our people.""",negative
590,"Story highlights Trump offered little clarity to Afghanistan's Ashraf Ghani about his long-term view on stabilizing the country
There are currently 8,400 US troops serving in Afghanistan as part of the NATO mission
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump phoned the leaders of Iraq and Afghanistan on Thursday, but even amid their discussions about combating terrorists, his contentious immigration executive order remained a sticking point.
Trump, who is now three weeks into his role as commander in chief, intended during the calls to make initial assessments of the men who have sometimes proved to be nettlesome partners to the US in its ongoing mission to rid their countries of militants.
However, Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi used a portion of his half-hour conversation to insist Trump remove Iraq from a list of seven countries whose citizens he's tried to temporarily ban from entering the United States.
Trump told Abadi he would direct the US State Department toward finding a solution, according to an official description of the phone call from Baghdad, but didn't promise to remove Iraq from the list.
Along with Iraq, Trump's executive order barred citizens from Syria, Libya, Sudan, Iran, Yemen, and Somalia from entering the US for 90 days. The order is in legal limbo; a judge issued a temporary halt on the order and visa-holders from those nations have been able to board US-bound planes while the matter moves through courts.

591,"Washington (CNN) New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman showed up at the Javits Center on election night expecting to celebrate the triumph of his home state's Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
He left, after a period of ""talking people off the walls and off the ledges,"" preparing to do battle with another New Yorker, Donald Trump -- again.
In the weeks since, Schneiderman -- who led the Trump University fraud lawsuit -- and the nation's other Democratic attorneys general have leapt to the forefront of the anti-Trump resistance, taking on his executive order banning immigration from seven majority Muslim countries.
Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, scored a major victory Thursday night when the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against reinstating Trump's travel ban. The ruling was made after Ferguson, joined by the attorney general of Minnesota, successfully sued for a halt to the ban, which was granted last week.
""No one is above the law,"" Ferguson told reporters Thursday night, ""not even the President.""
It's the first round in what's certain to be a years-long series of battles with the Trump administration over enforcement of labor, environmental and consumer protection rights, as well as health care and immigration laws.
""There's a sense of urgency and a real sense that we are now the guardians of the rule of law in the United States,"" Schneiderman said in an interview.
""That's the kind of thing that's tough to accept,"" he said. ""But we appear to be confronted by an administration where you question if you take the rule of law seriously.""
The attorneys general described to CNN a decision-making process on who would take on Trump based on which offices have budgets large enough to afford to do battle with the Justice Department, and based on which issues resonate most clearly locally.
Schneiderman, in a separate interview, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday's ""OutFront"" his legal antagonism toward Trump isn't personal.
""No, not at all. Again, I represent the people of the state of New York and I represent a lot of people who are hurt by this ban,"" he said. ""I represent people who had to make a choice between keeping their jobs and getting back to their families who were separated by this ban ... I have no choice but to go and pursue this.""
In the less than two weeks since Trump signed his travel ban, what had been semi-regular conference calls with Democratic attorneys general and, at times, their staffs, have become almost daily.
""We're going to be on the front lines of some of the most important battles for economic and social justice,"" said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring.
Post-election frenzy
In the wake of the election, Schneiderman offered guidance to states and counties that want to become ""sanctuaries"" that do not deport undocumented immigrants who abide by the law.
Noting a spike in hate crimes, he also issued updated guidance immediately after the election to law enforcement agencies on hate crimes.
In Virginia, Herring recently asked state lawmakers for more authority to prosecute hate crimes -- and to broaden the state's definition of hate crimes to more closely match federal law -- because, he said, he fears a less active Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department.
""Given what I heard during the campaign, I'm not optimistic,"" he said. ""It's probably not going to be a very high priority.""
""That's an example,"" Herring said, ""of where I have adjusted some of the work that we're doing and trying to make sure that we can keep a president in check if we need to.""
Many Democrats' eyes are on Schneiderman -- a dean of sorts among the group, in his second term in one of the nation's largest states -- and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is now just weeks onto the job and is expected to take on a bigger role in the coming months.
Schneiderman's office has bureaus devoted to labor, civil rights and to appeals and opinions. It also has the advantage of being situated in a state where the headquarters -- or major operations -- of a number of major companies.
Should federal agencies -- including the Labor Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which liberals fret the Trump administration will gut -- fail to enforce regulations, Schneiderman said his office is prepared to sue to force those rules' enforcement.
""Our office has been not shy about taking on federal agencies about not doing their job,"" Schneiderman said.
Right after Trump's election, Schneiderman also immediately warned Trump against withdrawing support of President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan. And he urged New York lawmakers to guarantee free contraception -- a backstop against GOP-led efforts to repeal Obama's Affordable Care Act.
Planning to take on Trump
The strategizing and coordination among the 22 Democratic attorneys general began at a conference in Fort Lauderdale hosted by the Democratic Attorneys General Association.
""It was a moment where we all looked around and realized, this is real,"" said Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin. ""President Trump being elected is a very real fact, and we need to start thinking about what we're going to do about that. He needs to be aware that as a group, we're going to be incredibly vigilant and assertive.""
They already had a model: Republicans during President Barack Obama's tenure.
Greg Abbott of Texas -- now the state's governor who served as its attorney general during most of Obama's administration -- led many of the GOP's legal battles against Obama's immigration orders. And Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Trump's pick for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, had regularly sued to block its regulations.
""In some ways, they created -- or maybe I should say they perfected -- a model of going to court and really standing against the presidential administration,"" said Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan.
Democrats had done it before, too. During President George W. Bush's second term, Massachusetts led a group of 12 states and several cities that sued to force the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases.
Travel ban spurs rush to court
The galvanizing moment, the Democratic attorneys general said, was when Trump signed an executive order banning travel to the United States from seven majority Muslim nations.
""As the hours went on, we literally had chaos at the Philadelphia airport,"" said Josh Shapiro, the newly-elected attorney general of Pennsylvania.
Several states rushed into court to try to block the implementation of Trump's travel ban -- but it was Ferguson who was most successful.
After a judge halted the implementation of Trump's travel ban, the offices of Schneiderman, Shapiro and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey led the drafting of an amicus brief in which 16 additional states backed Washington's case.
The most recent group phone call between the AGs came Tuesday afternoon, when Schneiderman and his staff, as well as the Democratic Attorneys General Association, led a discussion of the travel ban challenge just hours before oral arguments before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
""It was only like 80 years ago that a president's executive order based upon national security authorized citizens of Japanese ancestry, regardless of their backgrounds,"" Chin said. ""It became very important that this was going to be the battle I was going to fight.""",positive

596,"(CNN) The challenge to President Donald Trump's refugee order has escalated toward an epic showdown over presidential power, judicial authority and American identity.
By their questions in a hearing Tuesday, three US appeals court judges made plain that even at this early procedural stage they are concerned about the administration's potential targeting of Muslims along with possible risks to national security.
The judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also expressed unease with how quickly they were being pressed to consider looming dilemmas of refugee policy with no lower court hearings yet on both sides' evidence.
""Courts must act fast!"" Trump tweeted late Monday, as he warned about ""a threat from radical Islamic terrorism.""
Trump's natural impatience conflicts with the usual tendencies of the federal judiciary, which even in dangerous times attempts, as Chief Justice John Roberts has observed, ""calmly to poise the scales of justice.""
Trump's January 27 order suspending refugee admissions for at least 120 days and barring people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US for at least 90 days, has engendered more public protest and litigation than any of Trump's policy moves or Cabinet appointments to date.
More than anything else, it cuts to the core of the nation's character.
Among the ""friend of the court"" briefs filed ahead of the Ninth Circuit hearing was one from technology companies that addressed lost talent and revenue related to the ban but first highlighted America's reputation as a nation that welcomed immigrants.
""A quarter of us have at least one parent who was born outside the country,"" it said, referring to population statistics. ""Close to half of us have a grandparent born somewhere else. Nearly all of us trace our lineage to another country.""
The order also raises concerns that the nation would favor Christians over Muslims. The directive gives priority to refugee claims based on religious persecution but only ""if the religion of the individual is a minority religion"" in his home country. Given the list of countries targeted, the challengers say, that provision discriminates against Muslims.
In the administration's written filings and during arguments Tuesday, the federal government argued that the order was neutral with respect to religion and rightly focused on countries that have been breeding grounds for terrorism.
While trial judges across the country have been reviewing claims that the order exceeds the president's statutory and constitutional power, Tuesday's hearing marked the first time a federal appeals court took up a piece of the controversy.
It heard the Trump administration's appeal of US District Court Judge James Robart's order in a case brought by officials in Washington state and Minnesota preventing enforcement of the travel ban while litigation is underway.
Trump condemned Robart, referring to him as a ""so-called judge"" and deeming his ruling ""ridiculous.""
Wednesday morning, he insisted the government must win the case.
""If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!"" Trump tweeted.
If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017
Do Trump's campaign promises matter?
Appeals court judges expressed doubts about the government's terrorism claims but also pressed Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell about the broad reach of the order. They questioned whether to consider comments by Trump during the presidential campaign, such as the promise of ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.""
The Washington and Minnesota lawyers say judges should look to such statements and ""distinguish a sham"" purpose from a sincere one. Trump administration lawyers counter that the order can only be read on its face. They stress overall that judges ""are particularly ill equipped to second guess"" the President on security risks.
If the administration loses at this stage, it is likely to appeal to the Supreme Court for reinstatement of the ban.
But at this early point, with the Supreme Court still down a justice from last year's death of Antonin Scalia, it might be disinclined to take up the matter. The current bench is divided 4-to-4 along ideological and political lines.
Trump's nominated successor to Scalia, US Appeals Court Judge Neil Gorsuch, is unlikely to be on the bench before late spring.
A reminder of Korematsu
Still many more chapters could unfold in the dispute already raising comparisons to past legal clashes over presidential power at times of war and national crisis.
For the challengers, the dispute particularly recalls the 1944 case of Korematsu v. United States, in which the Supreme Court upheld a World War II executive order moving Japanese-American citizens into detention camps.
Since regarded as an egregious infringement on civil rights and one of the high court's worst decisions ever, Korematsu often emerges at judicial confirmation hearings.
During Chief Justice John Roberts' 2005 confirmation hearings, Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, asked whether Roberts would be a ""Korematsu justice"" and allow individuals to be targeted based on nationality or religion.
Roberts responded that the government was unlikely to resort ever again to such internment camps, yet also emphasized the need for constitutional vigilance when national security is under threat.
Roberts told senators he was reminded of a judicial motto tracing to the 1807 treason trial of Aaron Burr, that a judge's obligation even in dangerous times is ""calmly to poise the scales of justice.""",negative

The President may need Democratic votes to confirm his Supreme Court nominee
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump invited several red state Democratic senators to a White House lunch Thursday in hopes of wooing their support for his Supreme Court nominee and other agenda items, a White House official told CNN Monday.
The four senators -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana -- are up for re-election in 2018.
A White House official confirmed the lunch, which was first reported by USA Today , saying the President wants to talk to them -- and others -- about judges and his legislative package.
Trump will likely need the help of a few Democratic senators if he wants the legislative body to approve Neil Gorsuch , his Supreme Court pick. Manchin met with Gorsuch earlier this month. Otherwise, Gorsuch's confirmation will rely on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell changing the Senate rules in order for Republicans to approve the nominee on a party-line vote, something he is loathe to do.
Heitkamp met with Trump in December, setting off panic among top Democratic congressional leaders, some of whom worried the moderate would leave the Senate to take a job with the Trump administration. While Heitkamp did not take a job, she has shown a willingness to meet and work with Trump. The President won North Dakota 63% to 27% for rival Hillary Clinton.

598,"(CNN) President Donald Trump reiterated US support for Turkey as a ""close, long-standing"" partner, during a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday.
It was the two leaders' first conversation since Trump took office in January.
Trump welcomed Turkey's efforts in the battle against ISIS, according to a White House readout of the conversation, and spoke of both countries' commitment to fighting terrorism ""in all its forms.""
Turkish President Erdogan (L) spoke to US President Trump on Tuesday for the first time since Trump's inauguration.
But areas of ongoing tension were notably absent from the readout, including the latter's extradition request for exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen and US support for Kurdish groups in Syria
""Unpleasant issues that aren't mentioned include the future of Syria, who leads it, US relations with Iran, and all these are important in terms of the future of Turkey-US relations,"" Research Fellow at Sydney's Lowy Institute Rodger Shanahan said.
""They're trying to highlight the issues of common interest, which aren't that many, which is why they mention the Islamic State.""
Turkey-US relations cool
The relationship between Turkey and the US has grown increasingly complicated since a foiled coup in Turkey in July 2016. In response to the coup, Erdogan cracked down on the military and judiciary

Erdogan demanded the US hand over Gulen, whom he blamed for the coup attempt, but the Obama administration asked for proof of his involvement.
Trump praised the Turkish leader's handling of the coup in a July interview with the New York Times
""I give him great credit for being able to turn that around,"" he said.
The Trump administration's controversial travel ban, enacted in January 2017, has become another point of difference between the two countries.
Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek posted on his official Twitter on January 29 that refugees were welcome in Turkey
""We'd happily welcome global talent not allowed back into #USA,"" he wrote.
Safe zones
But Trump will need close relations with Turkey if he is going to enact one of his campaign promises to create ""safe zones"" in the war-ravaged country of Syria.
The Trump administration has yet to detail exactly what the safe zones will entail but, given Turkey's close proximity and military involvement, the US President will need their help.
""Trump's safe zone plan relies on Turkish cooperation and Trump has said unequivocally there will be safe zones,"" Shanahan said.
""There's a potential political win-win in this and Erdogan would know that it's a bone he could throw Trump for better relations at a relatively minimal cost.""",positive
599,"Story highlights Month-to-month numbers in apprehensions can be misleading
Still, Trump supporters are likely to see the numbers as vindication
Washington (CNN) Apprehensions at the southern border decreased sharply in January, according to statistics obtained by CNN -- a drop in line with yearly seasonal trends but that could give President Donald Trump an early talking point in his efforts to ramp up border security.
According to preliminary Customs and Border Protection numbers for January obtained by CNN but not yet released to the public, family unit apprehensions decreased by 42%, unaccompanied minors were down 39% and total apprehensions decreased by 27%.
Month-to-month numbers in apprehensions can be misleading. According to data for the past four years, apprehensions typically drop in January and did so sharply in 2016.
Next month's data could be critical in interpreting whether the drop was due to seasonal trends or something bigger. The amount of migration north through Mexico is also tied to the conditions in Central America, where many migrants are fleeing violence and drug cartels.
The numbers also do not take into account what are called inadmissables -- migrants who present themselves at the border and are deemed unable to enter the country, often due to lack of authorization. Apprehensions refer to those removable aliens who are arrested.

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan believes President Donald Trump's attempt to mend relations with Russia is understandable yet doomed to fail.
""What the President is trying to do is not unlike what the past two presidents did with Russia. I just don't think it's going to work,"" Ryan told PBS in an interview aired Wednesday. ""New administrations do this.""
Ryan said Trump's eagerness to work with the Kremlin was ""logical"" -- pointing to efforts by both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama White Houses to similarly soothe tensions -- but ultimately misguided.
Ryan, like much of the GOP, has long adopted a hawkish stance toward Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Trump has upended that orthodoxy, arguing that the US and Russia could find agreement on ways to combat ISIS.
And Trump's personal relationships to Russia have come under greater scrutiny since intelligence agencies disclosed that Russia was behind attempts to intrude on the 2016 presidential election, a conclusion Trump has been slow to admit.

602,"Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump is making her own quiet start in Washington, nearly three weeks since her father assumed office.
The first daughter has kept a relatively low profile, eschewing press interviews and making few public appearances.
She's been spotted by pool reporters in the West Wing, where her husband, Jared Kushner, serves as senior adviser to President Donald Trump. Last week, she accompanied her father on a trip to Delaware to pay respects to the family of a fallen service member, the solemn occasion highlighting their close relationship. She brought Mandarin-speaking daughter Arabella, 5, to the Chinese Embassy for a Lunar New Year party celebrating the ""Year of the Rooster.""

And on Tuesday, Trump posted a photo from the East Wing of the White House with 10-month-old son, Theodore, in tow.
""Taking a call in the White House with my personal assistant Theodore,"" she wrote, with a heart emoji.
While Trump does not have a formal role in her father's administration, she was a crucial voice during his presidential campaign, and before that, a key player in his real estate business, something unlikely to change.
Dinner party diplomacy
She plans to use her national platform as first daughter to continue to promote women's empowerment, a cause near to her heart and her skill set. In December, she called members of Congress about legislation aimed at making child care more affordable.

Since then, she's gotten to work building relationships, hosting two private dinner parties with business executives focusing on women in the workplace. The first working dinner took place before the inauguration at the home of friend Wendi Deng Murdoch; the second, last Thursday at her new DC home, per a source close to Trump. The dinners were first reported by Fortune and Politico
Both dinners were attended by Dina Habib Powell, a former Goldman Sachs executive who also served in George W. Bush's White House and State Department. Powell has been advising Trump, and now serves in a senior White House role focused on entrepreneurship, economic growth and the empowerment of women.
Familiar role
Trump's proximity to the White House is a natural extension of her Trump Tower childhood, growing up observing the inner workings of the Trump Organization under her father's tutelage.
""My father believed it was important for us to do hands-on work of some kind or other. He wanted us to get to know the people and the processes that actually made our company run, from the ground up. Even when we were kids, there was talk around the dinner table about how we all might join the family business some day,"" she wrote in her 2009 memoir.
Trump went on to work in real estate development for the Trump Organization, gaining her father's trust in the process.

From urging him to act more presidential during the rough-and-tumble months of the campaign to helping him pick his running mate, the President's eldest daughter, 35, is one of his closest confidants, top White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told Borger.
""Ivanka Trump was in a very unique position to give her father voice in choosing a vice presidential running mate. Because she knows what Donald Trump expects,"" Conway said.
Trump dismissed speculation that she would be the ""real"" first lady in a Trump administration, calling that observation ""inappropriate.""
""There's one first lady, and she'll do remarkable things,"" Trump told ABC News last month

She formally stepped away from the Trump Organization and her eponymous apparel and accessories brand in January. She divested herself of significant assets, including all of her common stock, and converted her equity in the Trump Organization into fixed payments, per an official briefing on behalf of the transition last month.

603,"Washington (CNN) Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch told a US senator Wednesday that President Donald Trump's tweets about the judiciary are ""demoralizing"" and ""disheartening.""
In a meeting with Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Gorsuch, who's largely been silent since Trump nominated him last week, took exception to Trump calling a federal judge in Seattle a ""so-called judge"" after blocking the President's travel ban.
""He said very specifically that they were demoralizing and disheartening and he characterized them very specifically that way,"" Blumenthal said of Gorsuch. ""I said they were more than disheartening and I said to him that he has an obligation to make his views clear to the American people, so they understand how abhorrent or unacceptable President Trump's attacks on the judiciary are.""
Ron Bonjean, who is leading communications for Gorsuch during the confirmation process, confirmed Gorsuch called Trump's tweet about the ""so-called judge"" ""disheartening"" and ""demoralizing"" in his conversation with Blumenthal.
Trump's comments could complicate the upcoming hearings for Gorsuch, who is certain to face questions about Trump's tweets from Democrats. Liberals, already concerned with Gorsuch's record, have also asked how he will demonstrate independence from the President.
But Gorsuch's statement could help him with some moderate lawmakers. In the private meeting with Blumenthal, and in one with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, Gorsuch seems to be trying to address the issue proactively.
Gorsuch told Schumer in a meeting Tuesday that an attack on his fellow judges is an attack on all, and he said he is incredibly disheartened when people attack his fellow judges, according to a source familiar with the discussion who paraphrased the judge's comments. He also told Schumer that judges are used to being criticized and are no one's lackeys.
Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he brought up examples of Trump's recent rhetoric, including the tweets and the President's criticism of the federal court Wednesday morning before law enforcement officials.
That's when Gorsuch expressed disappointment in Trump's comments, Blumenthal said. ""He didn't disagree with me on that point.""
""I said to him if a litigant before your court -- and the President of the United States is in fact a litigant right now in the immigration ban cases -- said what President Trump said, you would hold him in contempt of court,"" Blumenthal said, adding that Gorsuch did not give a response to that comment.
Schumer spokesman Matt House said Gorsuch isn't going far enough.
""Given the President's comments, that a very milquetoast response,"" House said. ""Anyone can be disheartened, but the judge refused to condemn the comments privately or publicly.""
Gorsuch meeting with senators
Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge from Colorado, has been meeting with senators on both sides of the aisle since being nominated last week.
Blumenthal said the two men met for 40 minutes in the senator's office, where they discussed their shared running habits and ""common love for the outdoors,"" among more serious conversations about Gorsuch's judicial views and background.
While Blumenthal described the meeting as ""amicable,"" he said he was ""disappointed"" in Gorsuch's responses to his questions and felt he was not being forthcoming and specific enough. He said he was especially looking for more answers on Gorsuch's thoughts about reproductive rights, workers' rights and consumer protection issues.
Asked if Blumenthal is open to supporting Gorsuch, the senator said he will wait until after the Judiciary Committee holds hearings on Gorsuch's nomination to make a final decision but that he has ""serious and deep concerns"" about him.
Blumenthal said he supports requiring a 60-vote threshold to confirm the Supreme Court nominee, and if he decides to oppose Gorsuch, Blumenthal said he will use ""every tool"" at his disposal to fight the nomination. Republicans need eight of their Democratic colleagues to break that threshold and prevent a filibuster.
Blumenthal was one of three Democratic senators that Gorsuch met with on Wednesday. He also sat down with Democratic Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota -- two states that Trump won.
Impact of Trump's tweets
Trump's tweets have disturbed many in the legal community . While it is not unusual for a president to disagree with a ruling from the Judicial Branch, Trump is using his Twitter account to call out individual judges while cases are being heard.
His "" so-called judge "" tweet came after Washington state-based federal Judge James Robart Friday blocked Trump's executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days. Trump's order also blocked all refugees from entering 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
Trump has continued to call out Robart in the days since the ruling.
""Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,"" Trump tweeted . ""If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!"" Trump tweeted.
The Trump administration has appealed Robart's temporary restraining order. A panel of judges from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments Tuesday and is expected to rule this week.
Last summer, Trump also went after US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was oveseeing a Trump University lawsuit. Although Curiel was born in Indiana, Trump said he was in an ""absolute conflict"" in presiding over litigation given that he was of ""Mexican heritage.""
Trump's comments also risk offending some current Supreme Court justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, who recently wrote about the importance of lower court judges. In his annual report last month, Roberts called judges ""selfless, patriotic and brave,"" and he said ""this is no job for impulsive, timid or inattentive souls.""
""You might be asking,"" Roberts wrote about life-tenured judges, ""why any lawyer would want a job that requires long hours, exacting skill and intense devotion -- while promising high stress, solitary confinement and guaranteed criticism.""
""The answer lies in the rewards of public service,"" Roberts wrote.
Art Roderick, a CNN contributor and a retired US Marshal, noted that Trump should be ""fully aware"" of what kinds of threats the judiciary receives because the President's own sister is a federal judge.
""Any time a federal judge receives a threat, the marshals investigate and provide the proper protection based on that threat,"" Roderick said. ""Anybody that has looked at what the US Marshals do has got to realize that an attack on any judge is an attack on the rule of law of the United States.""",positive
604,"(CNN) Scores of evangelical leaders, including at least one from each state, have taken out a full-page newspaper advertisement to denounce President Donald Trump's temporary ban on refugees, urging him to reconsider his executive order and welcome people fleeing persecution and violence.
On January 27, Trump issued an executive order that temporarily restricts travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries, suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for four months, indefinitely bars Syrian refugees and reduces the number of refugees the United States will accept from 110,000 to 50,000.
The order also says that religious minorities will be given preference, which many assume will apply to Christians in the Middle East. In a separate interview, Trump said persecuted Christians should be given priority over members of other faiths.
Dozens of religious leaders have denounced the executive order , and several states and legal organizations have sued to stop its implementation. On Tuesday, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments for and against the ban
The evangelicals' advertisement, which is slated to run in The Washington Post, is signed by 100 prominent evangelical pastors and authors, including some who rarely wade into politics. It is addressed to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.
Signees include Pastor Timothy Keller of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York, Christian author Ann Voskamp, Bill and Lynne Hybels of Willow Creek Community Church, preacher and author Max Lucado, Pastor Eugene Cho of Quest Church and Leith Anderson, president of the National Association of Evangelicals.
CNN obtained an early copy of the advertisement, which appears in the name of World Relief, an evangelical relief organization that has resettled thousands of refugees in the United States. In addition to the leaders who signed the print ad, hundreds more have endorsed its message online, said Scott Arbeiter, World Relief's President.
""As Christian pastors and leaders, we are deeply concerned by the recently announced moratorium on refugee resettlement,"" the evangelicals' advertisement says. ""As Christians, we have a historic call expressed over two thousand years, to serve the suffering. We cannot abandon this call now.""
The evangelicals acknowledge the government's ""crucial role"" in keeping the country safe and setting the terms on refugee resettlement. But Trump's executive order, they say, fails to strike the right balance between compassion and security. Meanwhile, innocent people are suffering, even as Christian ministries in the United States stand ready to help.
""While we are eager to welcome persecuted Christians, we also welcome vulnerable Muslims and people of other faiths or no faith at all. This executive order dramatically reduces the overall number of refugees allowed this year, robbing families of hope and a future. And it could well cost them their lives.""
While the advertisement is signed by evangelical heavyweights, several evangelical leaders who backed Trump during the campaign are supporting the ban. They include Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition; Franklin Graham of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association; and the Rev. Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Church in Dallas.
According to polls, most white evangelicals side with Trump.
More than half of white evangelicals (54%) and white mainline Protestants (53%) would support a law barring Syrian refugees from entering the United States, according to a survey conducted in June by the Public Religion Research Institute
A majority of those same groups, as well as a slight majority of white Catholics (52%), also endorse a temporary ban on Muslims coming to the United States from abroad, the survey found.
""We see a lot of statements from people saying they're evangelical leaders, but that most evangelicals don't recognize,"" said Ed Stetzer, executive director of the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in Illinois, and a signatory to the evangelical advertisement.
""These are key evangelical leaders, with names recognizable to most evangelicals. My hope is that it causes them to ask what the real facts are -- and that we can have (and have had) both security and compassion. I think many will notice the names (on the advertisement) and give this another look.""",positive

""They said you can't do that because then people are gonna pour in before the toughness,"" he said
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump -- even as he blasted lawyers contesting his immigration executive order -- detailed for the first time Wednesday his own hesitations about the controversial plan before it was signed.
Trump, speaking to law enforcement officials in Washington, said he argued before the order was finalized for giving travelers a month's notice before cutting off entry to the US.
But he said he was overruled by law enforcement officials, who he didn't name, alleging the delay could prompt a flood of dangerous terrorists into the country -- an explanation that failed to account for the lengthy process of obtaining a US visa or applying for refugee status.
""The law enforcement people said to me, 'Oh, you can't give a notice,' "" Trump said at a conference for the Major Cities Chiefs Association. ""I suggested a month. And I said, 'What about a week?' They said you can't do that because then people are gonna pour in before the toughness.""
It was a surprising admission, given the President's full-throated defense of his travel ban. He even tweeted Sunday after a judge suspended its implementation: ""Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system.

Seeking to lend his own legal argument for the order banning travel from certain Muslim-majority countries, Trump insisted that US presidents have wide authority to determine who may enter the United States.
As he read from US immigration law, the President declared that even a ""bad high school student"" could understand the language and find in his favor.
""I think it's sad, I think it's a sad day,"" Trump told a group of major city police officers and sheriffs in Washington.
On Tuesday evening, a federal appeals court heard arguments in the legal battle over the travel ban. The California-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will decide soon whether to reinstate the executive order. Until then, his order that temporarily bars all refugees from entering the country, and all immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, is halted.

Perez, the billionaire CEO of Related Group, has maintained a 20-year friendship with Trump.
They've done business together.
The Perez and Trump families have vacationed together.
Perez said he likes Trump and that he's always been a good business partner.
But the relationship stalled in December when Perez received an email from The Trump Organization that included attachments showing a border wall and a handwritten note from Trump.
""The handwriting was his,"" Perez said.
CNN was shown the email. The White House said it is unaware of the conversation between the two, and a senior White House official told CNN Trump has been looking at various blueprints and sketches of the wall along with his top advisers.
The email Perez received gives a glimpse into Trump's preliminary thinking about how to design it.
""Inside the email was the wall, you know, the 2,000 mile, 30-foot wall, with some sketches, and he said, 'I would love to get you involved in this. Please give me a call,'"" Perez said.
The picture actually shows two walls, a primary wall and a secondary wall, with a security road in between.
It's a design former border patrol agent Rowdy Adams believes would be most effective in an urban settings.
""(By) the time someone breaches that first barrier and gets across the roadway ... you might want a secondary fence to slow them down until a response vehicle shows up,"" Adams explained.
Trump has at times said he wants to build a wall all along the border. Other times, he's said that it's not necessary in places where there's a ""natural barrier.""
On Wednesday, Trump revealed the wheels are in motion.
""The wall is getting designed right now,"" he said.
But he won't have his friend's help.
Perez said he's a Democrat who, despite a request from Trump himself, did not support his candidacy.
""I am totally opposed to the wall because a) it's wrong and b) it's not going to work anyway ... It's an insult to all Hispanics and maybe all immigrants in this country.""
Perez believes an improved economy in Mexico is a better solution. He said he has five projects in Mexico right now.
""I think my Mexican partners would shoot me if I'm in any way involved in the wall,"" he said.
Perez, who was born in Argentina to Cuban parents, smiled and said he told Trump he has one more concern.

609,"Washington (CNN) It's an issue that's sunk Cabinet nominees in the past: Hiring an undocumented immigrant.
But two of President Donald Trump's key Cabinet picks -- Andrew Puzder for Labor secretary and Wilbur Ross for Commerce secretary -- may still have a path to confirmation despite having hired undocumented workers.
It's an especially ironic position for the Trump administration to find itself in after the President spent much of the campaign railing against illegal immigration.
Now that he's in the White House, his most controversial moves have involved immigration, including his executive order -- blocked in the courts for now -- that bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
Puzder admitted in a statement Monday that he and his wife ""employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the US.""
He fired the employee once he learned about her immigration status, offered to help her obtain legal status and paid back taxes, Puzder said.
In response to the admission, Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said Puzder should withdraw his nomination.
""This nominee should withdraw, because similar conduct forced Obama nominees and Clinton nominees to withdraw their candidacies,"" Murphy said in a statement.

But Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, stood by Puzder. And John Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, said he expected Puzder to get confirmed.
Ross, a billionaire Wall Street investor, also admitted last month he hired an undocumented household workers. He fired the household worker who deceived him about his or her immigration status, and said that he paid all applicable taxes for the employee.
A White House spokesman defended both Puzder and Ross as ""highly qualified"" nominees who will ""fiercely defend the President's agenda and work on behalf of the American people.""
""Their immediate actions in correcting their missteps are indicative of their commitment to serving the greater interests of our nation,"" he said.
Trump has yet to comment publicly on either Cabinet nominee's issues, but there is irony in the fact that the nominees to lead two organizations that work directly with labor and business issues ran afoul of immigration laws.
This is far from the first time Cabinet nominees have been embroiled in a illegal immigration issues. In the past, though, it has cost the nominees their appointments.
Linda Chavez, George W. Bush's pick to be labor secretary, withdrew her nomination after it was discovered she allowed a Guatemalan woman who was in the United States illegally to live in her home and gave the woman spending money.
Zoe Baird, Bill Clinton's pick to be attorney general, was sunk by revelations that she hired undocumented help. The storyline became known as ""Nannygate.""
The Labor Department, which Puzder could soon lead, oversees how undocumented immigrants are handled within the United States labor force. The Commerce Department, the agency Ross could helm, deals with business on immigration and -- at times -- could argue for or against immigration policy.
For example, Obama Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, regularly spoke out on immigration reform and once called on Congress to ""end the human suffering they have witnessed as a result of our current immigration system.""
Complicating the issue further is the fact that Puzder and Ross both have voiced support in the past for immigration reform, something antithetical to what Trump said on the campaign trail.
""The GOP needs to end the family drama and resolve the policy dispute, not least because it is the right thing to do in every sense -- economically, politically and morally,"" Puzder wrote in a 2015 Wall Street Journal opinion editorial
Puzder also seemingly contradicted Trump's actions in the piece, writing that ""the best way to protect American workers is to generate economic growth. This is not synonymous with aggressively restricting immigration.""
Ross has been less outspoken about his immigration views, but was a member of the Partnership for a New American Economy, a Michael Bloomberg-backed group that was pro-immigration reform.",neutral
610,"President Donald Trump's travel ban had been in effect for less than 24 hours when, 10 days ago, he offered a smiling review from the Oval Office.
""You see it at the airports,"" Trump said , ""you see it all over.""
Indeed, millions of Americans with access to television and internet, and the thousands protesters at international arrivals terminals around the country, were bearing witness to the effects of his executive order.
But what they saw was something much different from what Trump described in his off-the-cuff remarks. The airports were gripped by chaos . Visa holders, including legal permanent residents, were being denied entry into the US, turned back or detained by Customs clerks, as families and lawyers argued for their release. The legal fight over the order -- now temporarily stayed -- seems destined for the Supreme Court
A detained traveler reacts as being cleared through at the Dulles International Airport in Sterling, Va., on Saturday, January 28, 2017.
More than two weeks into his presidency, Trump and top White House aides seem to be operating in an alternate universe -- where the world media is ignoring global terror as a means of advancing shadowy political interests and opponents of the President's sweeping travel ban are either traitors or mercenaries
Even the most widely available statistics, when they contradict the administration's narrative, are cast as subjective or false measures. On Tuesday, Trump claimed -- falsely -- that the US murder rate is at its highest in ""45-47 years.""
""(Trump) said the press doesn't tell you that, doesn't like to report that -- the press doesn't like to tell it like it is,"" said CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter. ""In fact, the murder rate is not at a 45 year high. It has ticked up slightly in the last couple years, that's cause for concern, but the murder rate is much lower than it was, for example, in the 70s, 80s or 90s.""
Bad news is 'fake news'
In a tweet on Monday, Trump offered his worldview in stark terms.
""Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election,"" he said. ""Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.""
Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017
Putting aside that pre-election national polling turned out to be an accurate preview of the popular vote results , Trump in his tweet is not simply arguing against or spinning a particular survey. Instead, he is openly asserting that any empirically derived suggestion that his policies might be unpopular -- or not enjoying broad support -- are by definition misleading or false.
Trump runs hot and cold with the polls. In that way, he is not unlike other politicians, who lift up the numbers they like and downplay the figures they don't. But the new White House has broken from the usual spin cycle by promoting -- sometimes repeatedly -- a series of jarring, and easily disproved falsehoods.
In the reality described by Trump, a federal judge who ruled to halt the administration's travel ban would, along with the entire ""court system,"" be responsible for a potential terrorist attack.
Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017
The dynamic in the White House mimics Trump's personality, one former campaign official told CNN. He is someone who can lose interest quickly and turn to the next issue without much thought.
It's most apparent on Twitter, where the President will bounce between a variety of often unconnected agenda items and personal grudges.
Over 24 minutes on Friday morning, he mocked Arnold Schwarzenegger; rattled off an attack on the Iranian government; claimed that ""the FAKE NEWS media"" had lied about the nature of his testy conversation with the Australian prime minister; touted a morning meeting with the country's ""biggest business leaders""; and accused demonstrators of being ""professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters.""
The media conspiracy
Speaking on Monday, Trump built on this construction, placing the press in cahoots with the judiciary -- another willful enabler of global terrorism.
""You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice,"" Trump said during a visit to US Central Command headquarters in Tampa. ""All over Europe, it's happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported, and in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.""
JUST WATCHED Trump claims media won't cover terror attacks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump claims media won't cover terror attacks 02:30
Those reasons -- whatever the President thinks they may be -- remained unspoken.
What ""you understand"" could be anything, though the clear implication was that a monolithic media dedicated to repelling Trump, and thwarting the popular will, had launched a campaign to hide reality and cover-up for terrorists. For fans of the conspiracy theorist radio host Alex Jones and his Infowars, the fundamental argument was familiar.
Pressed to provide material proof of his claims, the White House released on Monday evening a list of 78 attacks it said ""did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources."" Among the incidents listed were the killings in Orlando and San Bernardino, California -- two bloody domestic attacks that received wall-to-wall coverage online, on television and in newspapers and magazines for days on end.
CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen -- whose reporting is a staple of the network's terror coverage -- did a more comprehensive review . Searching a database called Nexis that collects news reports from a wide range of sources and mediums, he found more than 78,000 mentions in total, in excess of 1,000 per listed attack. (And that number was likely on the low end, as Nexis yields no more than 3,000 hits per search.)
A false narrative
Over the past week, top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway has also muddied the waters in what increasingly appears to be a concerted effort to stoke anxiety over the presence and entrance of refugees into the US.
In an interview that aired last Thursday night on MSNBC, she invoked the role of two Iraqi refugees in masterminding the ""Bowling Green Massacre."" Her description of the deadly attack -- which did not occur -- was quickly called out by reporters, fact-checkers and confused viewers. Conway offered an apology of sorts the next day, tweeting that she had misspoken and meant to say ""Bowling Green terrorists.""
But by Monday, it had become clear that Conway's remark was not a one-off mistake. A reporter from Cosmopolitan said the President's trusted aide had referenced a ""Bowling Green massacre"" during a telephone interview a week earlier. Speaking to TMZ on the same day, she mentioned ""the masterminds behind the Bowling Green attack on our brave soldiers.""
Conway had not cut the story from whole cloth, but her framing was consistently misleading. In the actual case , two refugees living in Bowling Green, Kentucky, were arrested in 2011 and eventually convicted on charges they had sought to provide weapons and money from the US to al Qaeda fighters in Iraq. American troops -- not civilians -- were their targets.
The ""Bowling Green"" yarn was delivered in the midst of a pitched debate over Trump's travel ban and suspension of the US refugee program. Days earlier, the White House -- acting within their rights -- had fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration after she instructed federal attorneys not to defend the executive order in court.
Undermining opponents
In sacking Yates, though, Trump's White House also sought to present her as disloyal to the government and her employers. The official statement announcing the dismissal said Yates ""betrayed the Department of Justice"" and accused her of being ""weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.""
The attack fit into a consistent narrative of undermining or seeking to delegitimize political opponents or groups operating outside the administration's narrative framework.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer kept up the drumbeat on Monday, telling Fox News that nationwide protests against Trump and the travel ban were being organized and subsidized by some unnamed benefactor.
""Protesting has become a profession now,"" he said, without proof. ""They have every right to do that, don't get me wrong, but I think that we need to call that what it is: it's not these organic uprisings that we've seen through the past several decades.""
He offered no evidence and there would have been little time for protesters to plot the demonstrations; Trump's executive order was, according to the President's own tweet, purposefully delivered as a surprise.
""If the ban were announced with a one week notice,"" he wrote, ""the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week.""
With a grassroots protest movement dismissed, the nation's highest ranking law enforcement officer's loyalty questioned and the media accused of conspiring to cover up terror attacks, the Trump administration's reality is on a collision course with a divided nation.",negative

615,"(CNN) Three federal judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals are set to hear oral arguments at 6 p.m. ET Tuesday in the challenge to President Donald Trump's travel ban.
The lawsuit, brought by attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota, has captivated the nation since last Friday when a federal district court judge put a stop to Trump's executive order restricting travel for foreign nationals, and as a result, temporarily opened US borders to immigrants once again.
The hearing will be by telephone and livestreamed; here's what to listen for:
What's the hearing about?
US District Court Judge James Robart upended Trump's executive order nationwide Friday by temporarily halting the key provisions restricting travel for foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries (Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen) and refugee admissions.
The central question for the appellate court is whether Robart abused his discretion by putting a temporary hold on the travel ban. No court has addressed the constitutionality of the executive order thus far.
The players
The attorney general of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, filed the case and was later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota, Lori Swanson.
The suit is being defended by lawyers at the Civil Division of the Department of Justice in Washington, DC.
The randomly assigned three-judge panel includes Judge William C. Canby Jr, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland; who was appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush.
When is this hearing?
The appellate court has set an hour-long telephonic oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET. It will be available for live streaming through the court's website
Each side will get 30 minutes to make their case.
What are the states saying?
On Monday attorneys for the states that filed the lawsuit submitted their brief urging the appellate court to keep the travel ban suspension in place.
The states say that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President had ""unleashed chaos"" by signing the order.
They also argue that the government's claim -- that it would be ""irreparably harmed"" by keeping Robart's temporary suspension order in place while the case proceeds to the merits -- doesn't make any sense.
To accept DOJ's position, they argue, ""would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued, Defendants were suffering some, unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. That makes no sense. ...Preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.""
What is the Trump administration's argument?
The government submitted its own brief in response Monday evening.
DOJ continues to emphasize that the states do not have the ability to sue in this case and a district court judge does not have the right to second-guess the President's national security judgment in the immigration context.
But the government also raised a fallback argument in its latest court filing -- suggesting if the appellate court is inclined to uphold the Seattle district court's decision, then it must at least limit it to the class of people who have been previously admitted to the US -- like someone traveling on a student visa. In the government's view, aliens outside of the US who have never stepped foot on US soil have no constitutional right to enter the US.
What happens next?
The judges have a number of different options at their disposal to resolve this case, but it is unlikely that they would rule on whether the ban is constitutional (since that is not the question before them) -- the central issue is whether the executive order should remain suspended for now.
For example, the judges could dismiss DOJ's request for a stay of Robart's decision because, as the government acknowledges, temporary restraining orders are generally not appealable, or they could uphold his ruling -- but under either scenario the suspension of the ban would remain in place while the case moves forward with further scheduled hearings.
Alternatively, the appellate court could find Robart abused his discretion and overreached to include classes of people not protected under the Constitution (e.g., aliens living abroad) -- in which case the travel ban would go back into effect.
After the three-judge panel publishes its decision, the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case by the full appellate court (but is not required to do so in order to get the case in front of the Supreme Court).
Given the high stakes involved in this lawsuit, it is expected that whoever ultimately loses before the Ninth Circuit will most likely appeal to the Supreme Court.
At the moment, there are only eight justices on the court, meaning if there is a 4-4 split then the Ninth Circuit's ruling will be the law of the land.",negative
616,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is turning on the charm. Or at least, he's turning on his golf cart.
After a combative round of telephone diplomacy with even the staunchest US allies, the commander in chief is planning a more genial approach this week when he decamps with Japan's Prime Minister to his winter getaway in Florida for a round of golf.
He's not likely to instruct Shinzo Abe how to dance the Cotton-Eyed Joe, the way George W. Bush did when Vladimir Putin visited his Crawford, Texas, ranch. Nor is he hoping to replicate the courtside bro-out Barack Obama enjoyed with David Cameron at a March Madness game in Ohio.
But in bringing Abe to his ornate southern retreat Mar-a-Lago, Trump is nonetheless continuing a long tradition of presidents melding recreation and negotiation in their encounters with foreign leaders.
Trump, who is still seeking his diplomatic footing three weeks into his term, finds himself more relaxed at his oceanfront oasis than in the White House, where he's lived for less than a month. He hopes the gesture will also put the buttoned-up Abe at ease.
""That's the one thing about golf -- you get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch,"" Trump told a radio interviewer over the weekend.
The President has told aides he hopes to use golf and visits to Mar-a-Lago as a way to develop warmer ties with his foreign counterparts, many of whom are approaching his presidency with uncertainty. Trump, who prefers to sleep in his own bed, has expressed little interest so far in traveling abroad, though he's committed to attending a European NATO summit in May and accepted an invitation from Britain's Queen Elizabeth II for a state visit this summer.
At Mar-a-Lago, Trump is happy to play host. Overlooking the Atlantic on Florida's Gold Coast, the club is firmly Trump's turf. On his first trip there as president last weekend, he mingled in the club's living room with paying members even as a Washington state judge halted his controversial immigration order.
Friends say Trump is most relaxed in the confines of his estate -- or playing golf on the courses he owns nearby.
""He's able to relax on the golf course with people he knows and trusts and likes,"" said Robin Bernstein, one of Mar-a-Lago's original members, who speaks with Trump frequently when he's staying in Florida. ""I think that he finds golf kind of his outlet to relax. He loves it, he enjoys it, he's a fabulous athlete, and that's what he loves. Some people go fishing -- Donald loves golf.""
In Abe, Trump finds a leader eager to foster a closer bond with the US, particularly given Trump's tough criticism of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Japan was a partner in, and the costs of US security support provided to the East Asian nation.
""This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday after detailing the weekend trip.
Abe enjoyed a congenial working relationship with Obama, but the two men never developed warm personal ties. When Abe tried bringing Obama to Tokyo's best sushi restaurant in 2014, the US president grew restless as the dinner stretched for hours.

Abe is hoping to start fresh with Trump, already meeting once with the real estate mogul in November. The pair discussed bilateral ties in Trump's Louis XIV-style livingroom at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Abe brought along a gold-colored golf driver as a gift.
""I know he loves the game, and we're going to have a lot of fun,"" Trump said in the radio interview this week. ""I'll just make sure he's my partner.""
Trump's invitation for a weekend at his private club continues a well-established practice of vacation diplomacy for US presidents. His predecessors have acted both as hosts for their foreign counterparts and as guests at vacation spots and golf courses the world over.
But no recent president has owned as lavish a getaway home as Trump, or been so eager to show it off.
Obama, who maintained a residence in Chicago but rarely visited there himself, employed public properties instead to host foreign leaders away from the White House. Obama invited the new Chinese President Xi Jinping to the Sunnylands estate in Southern California for their first meeting, including a long ramble in scalding desert heat around the grounds.
He used Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, to reassure Arab Gulf leaders of his Iran nuclear deal in 2015. Accustomed to more lavish environs, leaders like Saudi King Salman sent top advisers instead.
More relaxing were his encounters with Cameron. After Obama flew him to Dayton for the NCAA tournament in 2012, Cameron reciprocated with a round of golf at the Grove Club in Hertfordshire. He was one of the few foreign leaders who joined Obama for golf -- others included the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Malaysia.

Bush, who swore off golf shortly after the start of the Iraq War, hosted more than a dozen leaders among the scrub brush at his Crawford ranch. His three-day summit there with Putin in 2001 featured line dancing and a barbecue, but little agreement on missile defense. A session with the Saudi King resulted in some awkward photos of the President holding the Gulf monarch's hand.
Bill Clinton used Camp David to try securing an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat at the end of his term. He wasn't successful; the wooded retreat proved less inspiring than it had 20 years earlier, when Jimmy Carter brokered a successful peace accord there between Israel and Egypt.
Like Trump, Clinton identified golf as an entry point into personal relationships with counterparts. A round in 2000 with Singapore's Prime Minister in Brunei started late and stretched well past midnight.
American leaders aren't alone in using quieter retreats as a setting for talks. When Obama visited Saudi Arabia in 2014, then-King Abdullah received him at his desert getaway oasis, Rawdat Khurayim, 35 miles outside Riyadh.
Trump, too, could soon find himself at another leader's vacation home when he travels to Britain -- though not necessarily to make him more comfortable.
Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, suggested this week that Trump's visit to the United Kingdom may take place at Balmoral, the Queen's Scotland estate, to evade the expected masses of protesters in London.
The palace later tamped down that speculation, noting the Aberdeenshire castle was privately owned by the royal family, and thus unsuitable for a state visit. But of the Queen's other official residences, two -- Windsor Castle, outside London, and Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh -- would at least move Trump away from the capital.",negative

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday his travel ban is ""common sense"" and that the challenge to the ban may make it to the Supreme Court.
During a meeting with sheriffs at the White House, the President was pressed by a reporter about how far he's willing to take his legal defense of the travel ban. Trump said he's going to take it through the system, explaining that ""it's very important for the country"" for it to be successful.
""We're not allowed to be tough on the people coming in? Explain that one. So we'll see what happens. We have a big court case. We're well represented and we're going to see what happens,"" he said.
When asked if the case will make it to the Supreme Court, the President said hopefully it doesn't have to. ""Some things are law, and I'm all in favor of that,"" he said.
""I actually can't believe that we're having to fight to protect the security, in a court system, to protect the security of our nation. I can't even believe it. And a lot of people agree with us, believe me,"" he added.

618,"Story highlights President Trump's Cabinet confirmations trail Obama and Bush
Only five Cabinet members confirmed so far
(CNN) With Betsy DeVos confirmed, President Donald Trump's Cabinet is now five down and 10 to go.
By contrast, President George W. Bush at this point of his first term had his entire Cabinet seated. President Barack Obama had all but three nominees in place by now. In fact, on Inauguration Day, Obama had six Cabinet nominees confirmed while Bush had eight.
So the new President is trailing considerably when it comes to getting his Cabinet choices through the Senate.
There are several reasons for this, ranging from the slowness of certain Trump nominees to submit background-check and conflict-of-interest paperwork, to controversial choices like DeVos, who garnered fierce opposition and required the first tie-break vote for a Cabinet nominee in US history.
Senate Republicans are determined to push through Trump's entire slate of choices, and a procedural vote Tuesday started the process required to break any filibuster on attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions.

The moves underscore concern over Trump's openness to Vladimir Putin
Washington (CNN) A growing number of senators from both parties plan to ratchet up their push to stiffen sanctions on Russia and demand Congress have the final say if President Donald Trump decides to weaken penalties on the country unilaterally.
The move by six senators is the latest warning from Capitol Hill to the new administration over US-Russian relations.

Washington (CNN) The US military is looking to lease space in Trump Tower.
""In order to meet official mission requirements, the Department of Defense is working through appropriate channels and in accordance with all applicable legal requirements in order to acquire a limited amount of leased space in Trump Tower,"" Lt.

After Trump's election, the US Secret Service investigated renting a floor in the same facility, a midtown Manhattan building that sits on one of the busiest streets in the country. The Secret Service did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
According to Jared Horowitz, who works for the company responsible for available commercial space at Trump Tower, the floors available to rent -- with the average floor space running between 13,500 to 15,500 square feet -- cost about $1.5 million a year.

The lawsuit, filed in New York Supreme Court, argues a now-retracted Daily Mail Online article published last August that falsely alleged the first lady once worked for an escort service has damaged her reputation to the tune of many millions of dollars. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages of at least $150 million, according to the filing.
""(Melania Trump), as an extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former professional model and brand spokesperson, and successful businesswoman"" had the opportunity to potentially earn millions based on the fact that she is ""one of the most photographed women in the world,"" according to the suit.
The suit was originally filed in Maryland but the judge dismissed it, ruling it had been filed in the wrong court.

Washington (CNN) White House aide Kellyanne Conway seemed to acknowledge Tuesday falsehoods spread by the Trump administration.
CNN's Jake Tapper asked Conway repeatedly about President Donald Trump's attacks on the press and spreading of misinformation. In response, she asked if those falsehoods should matter as much as what Trump does say and do correctly.
""How about the President's statements that are false?"" Tapper asked at one point. ""I'm talking about the President of the United States saying things that are not true, demonstrably not true. That is important.""
""Are they more important than the many things that he says that are true that are making a difference in people's lives?"" Conway asked in response.
At a different part in the interview, Tapper told Conway the President's words mattered and they were obscuring other things he did.

Washington (CNN) Sen. John McCain on Tuesday delivered a fiery, not-so-subtle rebuttal to President Donald Trump's argument that the United States and Russia are morally equivalent, at one point slamming his hand on a lectern in condemning the Russian regime.
The Arizona Republican was speaking about Russian critic and deputy leader of the Freedom Party Vladimir Kara-Murza, who's recently been hospitalized in Russia. His lawyer believes he was poisoned.
""Vladimir knew that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is a killer. And he's a killer. And he might very well be the next target. Vladimir knew there was no moral equivalence between the United States and Putin's Russia,"" said McCain, who's long been a fierce critic of Trump's rhetoric about Russia.
""I repeat,"" he continued, veering away from his prepared remarks and hitting the wooden lectern to underscore his point. ""There is no moral equivalence between that butcher and thug and KGB colonel and the United States of America, the country that Ronald Reagan used to call a shining city on a hill. And to allege some kind of moral equivalence between the two is either terribly misinformed or incredibly biased. Neither can be accurate in any way.""
McCain listed a number of other Putin critics and journalists who've allegedly been killed by the Russian government.

627,"In Hollywood, in Silicon Valley boardrooms, in the nation's highest courts , across thousands of lamenting Facebook posts, and even on the sidelines of your kid's soccer game -- there's one name on everybody's lips.
Donald Trump.
In just over two weeks as president, the former billionaire real estate mogul and reality star has seized control of the American zeitgeist. He's permeated almost every area of national life, thriving in a sea of publicity, controversy and conflict.
Plenty of past presidents, including Barack Obama and John F. Kennedy, quickly captured the national conversation after assuming office. But Trump's ubiquity is especially notable since it stems from his gargantuan, antagonistic personality and a governing philosophy that often exacerbates political and cultural fault lines.
Trump's swift capture of the national debate is testimony to the huge cultural power of the presidency and its capacity to shape the spirit of the United States and the world. But his constant in-your-face style also represents a risky experiment. He still has to prove his constant presence -- for good and bad -- can foster a successful presidency. And he's opening a new front in the cultural backlash coalescing among elites in the coastal entertainment, media and advertising hubs.
His hold on the media encompasses the deeply consequential -- he claimed Monday that journalists are underreporting the terrorist threat and he's put Iran ""on notice. "" But it also verges on the ridiculous.
Cue an instant torrent of Internet-breaking social media posts showing a younger Trump lounging on a bed in a crisp white bathrobe.
The waves set off by the Trump presidency are now crashing over the business world . He's at odds with more than 100 of the nation's top companies, including Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, which are fighting his immigration executive order.
Intense emotional experience
It's just another way the intense emotional experience of the Trump presidency is careening through business, politics, the arts, and popular culture.
Sometimes the Trump effect is being manifested in unusual ways.
Within days of his taking office, copies of George Orwell's ""1984,"" the legendary story of an authoritarian world of government doublespeak, sold out on Amazon. Readers perhaps wanted to know what happened in a fictitious political project apparently reminiscent of what Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway called ""alternative facts.""
But in Orwell's dystopian vision, Big Brother was watching you. In Trump's America, everyone is watching him.
For now, Trump seems to be happy just dominating the conversation. His omnipresence is such that even events that have little to do with the new President suddenly seem to take on new significance because of him.
Take the Super Bowl -- one of the few unifying events left in American life.
Going into Sunday's big game, one of the big questions was whether Lady Gaga's half-time show would be an overtly political denunciation of Trump. After all, it's now almost obligatory for Hollywood awards galas to feature anti-Trump screeds and for pop stars like Madonna and Bruce Springsteen to jab the President from onstage.

Lady Gaga did perform an anthem celebrating the LGBT community and equality -- with Vice President Mike Pence in the audience. But she did so in an understated way. Indeed, in one of the least partisan moments in a politically fraught few weeks , she put on a pageant of national unity, belting out ""God Bless America"" before singing ""This Land Is Your Land.""
But there was an undeniable political undercurrent in Super Bowl ads, which usually avoid political edginess.
Several spots appeared to contain anti-Trump themes.
In an ad for 84 Lumber , a Hispanic mother and daughter apparently set out on a journey to cross the southern US border. In the full version, published online, the pair are confronted by a huge wall before a gate swings open for them to enter a paradisaical sun-drenched America.
Given Trump's repeated vows to build a border wall, it was hard to view the ad as anything but a criticism of the President. 84 Lumber, a building-supply company, said the ad was initially rejected for being too ""controversial"" so it cut the wall out of TV version.
Budweiser, known for its tear-jerking ads with galloping draft horses, also took a political turn, highlighting the tough immigrant journey of one of its founders Adolphus Busch, to pursue his American dream.
""Go back home,"" Busch is told in one shot. Though the ad pre-dated Trump's temporary entry ban on the nationals of seven mostly Muslim nations, the message's spot seemed more powerful with that in mind.
Sudden awakening
That such a viewpoint is even possible reflects a sudden awakening triggered by Trump in a nation which now appears more politically on edge -- but also more attuned to dissent and debate -- than it has been for years.
For liberals, the crusade is being reflected in the arts.
The most notable case is ""Saturday Night Live's"" abrasive, sometimes sinister portrayal of Trump (by Alec Baldwin) and his advisers. This week, White House adviser Steve Bannon was played as the ""Angel of Death.""
Another sketch, in which actress Melissa McCarthy plays Spicer , is quickly becoming one of the most talked about SNL skits in years.

The President hasn't taken the lampooning well, frequently firing off on Twitter about the show.
But maybe he protests too much.
""Trump takes himself so seriously. Being parodied on SNL is like a right of passage. It's like 'Oh my God' that are writing about me, I am in the Zeitgeist,"" Judy Gold, an Emmy Award-winning writer and comedienne, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Monday.
Trump may also be angry like a fox.
His feuds with Hollywood, his refusal to play along with SNL and his jousts with the media and the Silicon Valley tech titans amount to more than a rejection of the pop culture that made him.
He's aligning himself exactly with the views of many of his supporters who disdain what they see as the elite's political correctness and smugness.
Even people who have worked for Trump admit he makes an odd blue collar hero, given his eponymous Manhattan tower dripping with gold leaf and his life once lived in the pages of New York gossip columns and his obsession with one particular spoil of pop culture -- the cover of Time magazine.
""He is the unlikeliest of populist leaders,"" said one senior administration official who requested anonymity to talk about the President.
This person theorized that Trump already had a common touch before entering politics but that he refined his blue-collar instincts by showing deep curiosity about the lives of his voters on the campaign trail, then thinking about their lives and problems.
""That allows him to see what people are like throughout the rest of the country,"" the official said.
Perhaps that knowledge is one reason why Trump could not care less that he's now apparently despised by the popular culture he once strove to join.
If everyone is obsessed with him, his work might already be part done.",negative
628,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's rhetoric on the timeline for repealing and replacing Obamacare has changed, and it's no accident.
Staffers on Trump's legislative affairs team, along with other GOP allies, have been working to manage the President's expectations about the time the complicated process will take, which appears to have contributed to Trump's change in language, according to a senior administration official.
In January, Trump told The New York Times that he was hoping for a vote to repeal Obamacare as soon as the week of his inauguration and called for replacement legislation ""very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.""
But in his recent interview with Fox News , when asked when the Trump administration would roll out a new health care plan, the President suggested a much slower timeline stretching into 2018.
""Maybe it'll take until sometime into next year but we're certainly going to be in the process,"" Trump said. ""I would like to say by the end of the year at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year.""
Trump's legislative aides have been running him through potential scenarios that could crop up during the repeal-and-replace effort and trying to give him a better sense of how the process will work.
Still, an administration official made clear that Trump's 2018 timeline is a reference to the later stages of the health care overhaul. For instance, it could be 2018 before the replacement plan is fully implemented, particularly because certain aspects of replacement legislation will require support from Democrats as well as Republicans.
The official said the administration is sticking to its pledge to ensure Americans don't face a sudden loss of health care coverage before new health care options have been put in a place.
Or, as Trump put it during his presidential campaign: ""I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.""
The Trump administration has been working with House Speaker Paul Ryan's office on this issue and is expected to continue to do so, with more coordination with Health and Human Services nominee Tom Price once he is confirmed. Multiple sources said there's little indication the White House is working on its own Obamacare replacement plan.
The key message to Trump's team, from the offices of both Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has been the need to impart upon Trump that this is a process. Despite the noise from outside conservative groups, or even members of their own conferences, a careful, step-by-step process is not only the plan, but also the smartest way to go about the process.
It's a message, GOP aides say, that Vice President Mike Pence has agreed to carry back from Capitol Hill after his repeated meetings with lawmakers.
In the House, Ryan's team has made clear they plan to move a bill to repeal large swaths of the law by the end of the first quarter of the year. The Senate will move in a similar timeline. In the meantime, the arduous, time-consuming replacement process is starting to kick into gear.

""It's not sexy, we get that. But it's the reality,"" one GOP aide told CNN.
On one level, it's a ""Schoolhouse Rock"" explanation of the road ahead. That means committee hearings in both chambers on draft pieces of legislation -- some of which have already started in the House. Then it means the committees will consider each piece of legislation. Then those bills will move to the floor in each chamber.
""There was never going to be some 1,000-page replacement bill,"" the aide said. ""That's what we ran against.""
Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, told CNN he was urging his restive GOP colleagues, particularly those in the House, to slow the process down.
""I've seen speed. I've seen partisan results. It's called Obamacare,"" he said. ""I don't want to go down that road. My goal is to get it right and there's no timetable associated with that.""
Throughout, aides say, the strategy will be for Price's HHS to ease the burdens on the system and help build the bridge to replacement through administrative actions.",negative

""I'd say that in a speech and everybody was surprised because the press doesn't like to tell it like it is,"" Trump said during a meeting with US sheriffs at the White House. ""It wasn't to their advantage to say that. The murder rate is the highest it's been in I guess 45-47 years.""

London (CNN) The Speaker of Britain's House of Commons says he is ""strongly opposed"" to letting US President Donald Trump address lawmakers during his state visit to the UK.

Bercow is one of three parliamentary officials who must approve any invitation for someone to speak in Westminster Hall, the venue typically used for grand occasions of state.

635,"(CNN) Donald Trump has made one thing clear, there's a strong man now in the Oval Office.
But while the emerging Trump doctrine is based on uncompromising presidential strength, the foreign policies that will define his administration are much less clear. US allies and enemies still don't know whether the new White House simply represents a change of tone or a true shift in America's global role.
Since taking office two weeks ago, the new President has shown little patience for diplomatic subtlety.
He dealt brusquely with allies like Mexico and Australia, expressed hostility to the European Union, defended Russian President Vladimir Putin and put Iran ""on notice."" His conduct has exacerbated global concerns about a President who campaigned on a populist platform deeply critical of the existing world order and questioned the value of US alliances.
And while the administration denies that restrictions on travel from seven countries represent a ""Muslim ban"" administration officials do not dispute that Trump has dispensed with what he sees as a politically correct view of Islamic radicalism pursued by two administrations since 9/11.
Trump's self-styling as a brawny leader will continue when he travels to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, the headquarters of Central Command and Special Operations Command on Monday to meet generals and address troops.
The visit follows a US raid on an Al-Qaeda camp in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL was killed, acting on Trump's first operational order as President.
CENTCOM has responsibility for the Gulf Region that includes Iran, so Trump's visit will be seen as no coincidence amid escalating tensions with Tehran triggered by its test firing of a ballistic missile just over a week ago, a development seen as laying down an early gauntlet to the new president.
""They are not behaving themselves,"" Trump told reporters Friday after a week of swiftly rising tensions with Tehran.
But it is not yet clear whether Trump's dominant, theatrical presidential persona is more an attempt to keep faith with voters who elected him, or part of a deeply conceived new foreign policy strategy.
""From now on, it's going to be America First. That's how I got elected, that's why you voted for me, and I will never forget it,"" Trump said in his weekly weekend address. Those comments gave credence to theories that Trump's tough guy swagger is more of a political device than a thought out diplomatic gambit. And his administration's first serious attempts to engage the world are provoking questions about exactly who is the dominant voice in foreign policy.
Mattis, Haley differ from Trump statements
After a campaign in which Trump cast doubt on US alliances in Asia, his new defense secretary, James Mattis, used his first trip to the region to reassert conventional US security guarantees to Japan and South Korea.
He also said he didn't see any need for ""dramatic military moves"" in the South China Sea, contradicting earlier White House suggestions that Washington would move aggressively to counter Beijing's territorial claims in the region.
Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, added to the uncertainty when she said last week sanctions would remain on Russia until it left Crimea. Her stance -- in line with the previous administration's policy -- appeared to conflict with Trump's desire to improve relations with Moscow.
Combined with last week's confirmation of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the White House's control of foreign policy over the past two weeks may also start to be counterbalanced by other institutional influences in Washington.
Embracing Putin
Trump added to the confusion on foreign policy on Sunday when he appeared to draw a moral equivalence between Putin, who has been accused of murdering journalists and political opponents, and the United States.
""There are a lot of killers. You think our country's so innocent?"" Trump asked Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly in a Super Bowl half time interview.
The tension between Trump's strongman instincts and more mainstream foreign policy influences in his team are one reason why leaders such as British Prime Minister Theresa May and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (who will be in Washington this week) were so keen to meet him early on.
""This administration has a great difficulty in concluding any type of policies because of the tremendous ideological contradictions that exist within the administration itself,"" Trita Parsi, President of the National Iranian American Council told CNN on Saturday.
""Part of the reason why we are seeing this chaos is precisely because (of) a few people inside the White House and the (National Security Council) trying to run over the entire bureaucracies.""
Aimed at a domestic audience
Many of Trump's first moves in foreign policy appear to have been rooted as much in domestic politics as global strategy, for instance his executive order on the travel bans, his telephone showdown with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a refugee deal and a feud with Mexico over its refusal to pay for a border wall that led to the cancellation of a presidential visit.
But those political machinations are causing confusion around the world.
""My general reaction is that it has been fairly chaotic,"" said former Democratic Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" Sunday.
Critics of Trump's brazen approach worry that the president's penchant for personalizing disputes risks laying down red lines, alienating allies and sending conflicts spinning out of control.
New Iran plan
Nowhere is the new strutting tone of US diplomacy more obvious than in the case of Iran.
The new White House leapt at a chance to show its toughness, sending a signal that it intends to confront Tehran's efforts to project power in the region in a way that threatens US allies, for instance complaining at attacks on Saudi ships by Iranian backed Houthi rebels fighting a civil war in Yemen.
In a striking signal of a new US approach, Trump sent National Security Adviser Michael Flynn into the White House briefing room to warn on Wednesday that Iran was now ""on notice.""
The new administration believes that former President Barack Obama downplayed Iran's activity in the wider Middle East, including support for terrorism to safeguard his legacy-enhancing nuclear deal.
""Iran is playing with fire, they don't appreciate how 'kind' President Obama was to them. Not me!"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday.
But there is little clarity on how far the administration will go to confront Iran. Officials say that sanctions imposed on Friday do not mean that Trump will follow through on campaign trail threats to trash the nuclear deal.
The tough rhetoric though has some analysts worried that the new administration could be starting an escalation it can't control.
""They are going to test again, then the question is what does the administration do? "" said Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East negotiator for Republican and Democratic administrations.
""They have begun to draw a line and if you don't respond in a tougher way then you are perceived to be weak or are humiliated. If in fact you respond militarily you create an escalatory cycle.""
Trump spokesman Sean Spicer says the air of uncertainty is deliberate and is part of a campaign to keep other leaders guessing.
""I think one of the things that the president has said throughout the campaign, during the transition and since becoming president, is that he doesn't like to telegraph his options,"" Spicer said.
""That's how he believes that you can have a much greater successful option.""
James Jay Carafano, a Heritage Foundation analyst who worked on Trump's transition team believes that seeking deep foreign policy truths in the President's tweets and comments is a mistake.
""That public persona is not strategic signaling. That is just Trump being Trump. Pretty soon, people are going to look for other things when they look at what is true strategic signaling,"" Carafano said.
""Trump means exactly what he says, you just have to figure out exactly what he means,"" Carafano said.",negative
636,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump turned to his favorite outlet for outrage over the weekend when he blasted out tweets to his 23.9 million followers lambasting the federal judge who temporarily suspended the President's executive orders on immigration.
After only three weeks in office, he is launching an unusual attack -- not just on a particular ruling, but targeting a specific judge.
""Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,"" Trump wrote. ""If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!"" Trump wrote.
The message was clear. If there's a terrorist attack, it's the judge's fault.
The tweet raises complications for Trump's own Justice Department lawyers, who are arguing in federal courts trying to save his executive order. It also complicates the upcoming testimony of his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and raises safety concerns for those who believe that life tenured judges shouldn't be subject to personal attacks from government officials.
""I have seen a direct correlation between threats and inappropriate communications to judges stemming from the negative rhetoric of public officials,"" said John Muffler, former US Marshal who now works for Gavin de Becker and Associates. ""It is not an ideal situation as it creates and can ferment negative behavior towards judges.""
It also risks offending some Supreme Court justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, who recently wrote about the importance of lower court judges. In his annual report last month, Roberts called judges ""selfless, patriotic and brave,"" and he said ""this is no job for impulsive, timid or inattentive souls.""
""You might be asking,"" Roberts wrote about life-tenured judges, ""why any lawyer would want a job that requires long hours, exacting skill and intense devotion -- while promising high stress, solitary confinement, and guaranteed criticism.""
""The answer lies in the rewards of public service,"" Roberts wrote.
Safety of judges
Roberts also oversees the Judicial Conference, the policy making body for the federal court. It includes a committee on Judicial Security established in 2005 after Judge Joan Lefkow's mother and husband were murdered.
In testimony before Congress, Judge Lefkow made a plea to lawmakers: ""I ask you to publicly and persistently repudiate gratuitous attacks on the judiciary,"" she said.
""It seems to me that even though we cannot prove a cause and effect relationship between rhetorical attacks on judges and violent acts of vengeance by a particular litigant, fostering disrespect for judges can only encourage those that are on the edge, or the fringe, to exact revenge on a judge who ruled against them,"" she said.
This isn't the first time Trump's gone after a judge.
Last summer, Trump went after US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who had ruled against him in a Trump University lawsuit. Although Curiel was born in Indiana, Trump said he was in an ""absolute conflict"" in presiding over litigation given that he was of ""Mexican heritage.""
Noel Francisco, Trump's acting solicitor general, has started his new job off with a flurry of litigation. But even after the current controversy is settled he will appear before the justices many times over the next few years to argue the government's position.
Francisco is a seasoned lawyer and he will argue before justices who are not unfamiliar with the political debates that often swirl outside of the Supreme Court building. Indeed, the justices received a public scolding in 2010 from President Barack Obama at the State of the Union concerning the Citizens United campaign finance decision. But that was not singling out one justice.
Trump's attacks on judges won't do Francisco any favors.
Gorsuch will face questions
And they will certainly further cloud the upcoming hearings for Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. He already has to deal with Democratic senators furious about last year's treatment of Obama nominee Merrick Garland. Now Gorsuch will have to field questions about Trump's views on the judiciary, and whether he can be independent from the man who appointed him to the bench.
Trump's tweet received nearly 125,000 ""likes"" by Monday afternoon. Attacks, however, came in from lawyers on both sides of the spectrum.

Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, suggested there was a level of intimidation in the tweets.
""By levying attacks and slights on judges, the President is creating an environment that suggests judges must be prepared to carry out his bidding,"" she said.
Josh Blackman, a law professor at Southern Texas College of Law in Houston, called the comments a ""rant"" that's par for the course for Trump.

637,"(CNN) US President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again travel ban is back with the courts after a tumultuous weekend, when an appeals court opted to keep in place the temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge until a final ruling can be made.
Trump's executive order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days, bans all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
So what's the latest with one of the new administration's most controversial moves so far?
What happened?
On Friday, federal Judge James Robart of the US District Court for the Western District of Washington temporarily suspended key parts of the executive order nationwide.
The powerful 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, a federal appeals court in San Francisco, early Sunday denied the US government's emergency request to resume the ban. That court ordered both sides to submit arguments for and against the ban by Monday night.
The 9th Circuit scheduled oral arguments for Tuesday evening in the matter. Lawyers will make their cases to three federal judges in an hourlong hearing to determine the immediate fate of the temporary restraining order.
Regardless of the outcome, the loser is expected to appeal to the US Supreme Court.
How has Trump taken it?
He's fuming. Over the weekend he fired off several tweets blasting Robart's decision , in one referring to the Bush appointee as a ""so called"" judge.

In another, he said, ""Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!""
Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017
Trump's Justice Department sent out a strongly worded filing, emphasizing that halting enforcement of the travel ban ""harms the public"" and ""second-guesses the President's national security judgment"" in the immigration context.
""(Robart's ruling) contravenes the considered judgment of Congress that the President should have the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class of aliens,"" the Justice Department wrote.
Are people traveling?
Robart's ruling suspended the ban, and the rejection of the appeal means it's no longer in effect until the ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Recent Clemson University graduate Nazanin Zinouri touched down in Boston's Logan International Airport early Sunday afternoon after more than a day of air travel from Tehran -- she had left the US on vacation on January 20, the day of Trump's inauguration.

What is the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals?
The three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based court has a reputation as one of the most liberal in the nation -- to the point where some Republican lawmakers have even pushed to split it up in an effort to limit its impact.
The court will not rule on whether the ban is constitutional, but whether it will remain suspended for now.
When could the ruling come?
Both sides filed legal briefs Monday at the request of the court.

Lawyers for Washington state and Minnesota asked the court to leave the temporary restraining order in place, arguing that the government has failed to show that it would be ""irreparably harmed"" by a suspension of the executive order.
Unsurprisingly, the government said Robart's injunction should be lifted and the executive order should go back into effect while the legal process continues.
""The Executive Order is a lawful exercise of the President's authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees,"" the Justice Department wrote in a brief.
The panel will hear oral arguments Tuesday and is expected to rule shortly after.
After the three-judge panel publishes its decision, the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case by the full appellate court. A rehearing is not required, though, in order to get the case in front of the Supreme Court. Given the high stakes, it is expected that whomever ultimately loses before the 9th Circuit will most likely appeal to the US Supreme Court.

People close to the White House said over the weekend that Trump's attacks will be a problem -- particularly as his administration shepherds his Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch toward confirmation.
What happens if court rules for -- or against -- the ban?
Trump is unlikely to give up on his executive order, and it is entirely possible that the states would also appeal, should the ruling go against them. So no matter what the ruling is in San Francisco, the next stop will likely be the US Supreme Court
""Ultimately, one way or another, this case ends up at the Supreme Court,"" writes CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos.
""Other cases are pending throughout the country, and the odds are that there will be a serious split among the federal appellate courts, one that can only be resolved by the high court.

638,"Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin was once again in the headlines as the President drew sharp criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike by equating Putin's government with the US's.
The latest flap came when Fox News host Bill O'Reilly said ""Putin's a killer"" -- a reference to Putin's past as a KGB agent and instances in which his political opponents and critics have died suddenly -- and Trump shot back, ""There are a lot of killers. We get a lot of killers. What, you think our country's so innocent?""
Trump's comments revived questions about his ties to Moscow, which is accused of interfering to help the Republican candidate win.
On Tuesday, Trump tweeted about the perceptions of his relationship with the Russian leader, writing in part, ""I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy...""
I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!
The outrage about Trump's many warm words for Putin has been fueled more by rhetoric than reality: So far, the administration has made very few policy announcements about how it will actually deal with Moscow.
And the few indications Trump officials have offered on Russia policy have either been contradictory or confusingly mixed:
-Administration officials have signaled radically different approaches to the sanctions in place against Russia for its aggressive support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea.
-They have both condemned Russia for its human rights violations and refused to do so.
Trump has questioned the need for NATO and voiced his strong support for the organization. And while Trump and his top security adviser have said they want better relations with Russia, they're also poised to support new NATO members despite opposition from Moscow.

""There isn't anything yet resembling a formal policy from the administration,"" said Matthew Rojansky, director of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center. ""The pieces don't yet add up to a particular deal in the offing.""
Even so, lawmakers are preparing to get tougher on Russia and girding for a possible fight with the White House about that. There are ongoing Congressional investigations into ties between Trump, Russia and Moscow's interference in the election. And lawmakers from both parties support sanctioning Russia for its alleged hacking during the campaign.
Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is warning Trump and the White House that if they were to roll back sanctions on Russia without concessions from Moscow, the Senate would act. Rubio pointed to Russia's support for Ukrainian separatists that is destabilizing that country.
""There's a real threat of lifting sanctions minus the respect of Ukrainian sovereignty, and Putin meeting those conditions,"" Rubio said, speaking with CNN's Manu Raju about the sanctions legislation. ""My sense is that we'd be able to pass that in the Senate and that we'd be able to pass that with a veto-proof majority.""
The structure for creating a new US-Russia relationship isn't even fully in place yet. Trump and Putin had their first call on January 28, with the Kremlin and White House issuing general language about bilateral relations in need of repair.
But the White House has yet to put Russia-focused staff in place on the National Security Council or at the head of the relevant State Department bureau. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has deep ties to Russia, was confirmed only last week. The State Department wouldn't comment on whether he has spoken yet to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Once the new administration is fully up and running, it will have to engage on the many reasons for hostility between Russia and the old administration.
Beyond annexing Crimea, Moscow has worked to destabilize EU allies through fake news operations and hacking, lawmakers and former administration officials have said. Russian jets and submarines have harassed US allies in the Baltics, and, in November, Moscow announced plans to move nuclear-capable missiles closer to US allies in Eastern Europe.
Russian jets made several provocative and unsafe intercepts of US aircraft last year, and the US said Russia was responsible for the bombing of a UN aid convoy in Syria. Obama administration officials charged that Moscow either conducted the bombing or turned a blind eye as Syria did. US officials and lawmakers also charge that Russia has never really targeted ISIS in Syria, instead turning its guns on US-backed moderates.
Russia, for its part, has chafed at NATO's steady expansion toward its borders, a development it sees as a broken US promise. And Putin reportedly held the US in general and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in particular responsible for rallies against him during 2012 Russian elections.
Despite the tensions, Trump took positions during the campaign that were staunchly pro-Russian, praising Putin and calling for better relations, saying, ""Why not?""
But the early weeks of his administration have done nothing but muddy the waters on what his actual approach to Moscow will be.
After months of deriding NATO as ""obsolete"" and lacking a relevant mission, Trump has recently been executing what looks like a shift, after strong statements of support for NATO from Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.
On Monday, Trump said he ""strongly supported"" NATO, while calling on member countries to boost their financial support for the alliance. Trump also has committed to attending a meeting of NATO leaders, to be held in Europe in May.
There's been a seeming shift on Ukraine as well. After suggesting on the campaign trail that he might recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, the administration told the UN last week that it will keep sanctions against Russia in place until it leaves Crimea.
Haley's fiery speech to that effect came just a week after Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway had said the administration was considering easing sanctions against Russia.
Vice President Mike Pence repeated administration concern about eastern Ukraine on Sunday, telling ABC's ""This Week"" that the US is ""very troubled"" by escalating violence there and that Washington will be ""watching"" to see what Russia does.
Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that there might be a silver lining to the Trump administration's mixed messages.
""I'm beginning to think that the administration's confusion and disarray could actually save it from serious mistakes,"" Sestanovich said. ""Putin might like the idea of doing a deal with Trump, but who would do a deal with an administration that doesn't know what it thinks, how to act on it, or how to sell it at home?""",positive

(CNN) President Donald Trump vowed stout support for NATO on Monday, even as he insisted again that member countries scale up their defense spending on the alliance.
Trump has offered varying stances on NATO during his campaign and presidency, calling the membership obsolete and ill-prepared to confront modern-day threats. His remarks Monday signaled he would maintain US backing for the partnership while continuing to press other countries to meet its budget requirements.
""We strongly support NATO,"" Trump said at the headquarters of US Central Command in Florida.

Trump has long criticized the shortfalls, suggesting the US was subsidizing other nations' security at the expense of its own. But since taking office, he's avoided the harsh rhetoric he used on the campaign trail questioning the alliance's relevance.

640,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump and his surrogates have embraced a style that eschews what they deride as political correctness, making for a long record of unguarded public statements.
And that could come back to haunt the President in court.
""Taking Trump seriously, not literally"" has become something of a mantra in understanding the brash businessman since the phrase was coined by writer Salena Zito, now a CNN contributor.
But as his controversial executive order banning individuals from seven majority-Muslim countries is challenged in the courts, judges will be confronted with his and his surrogates' record of statements -- and could take them both literally and seriously.
Legal challenges to the order point to a series of statements about Trump's intent to ban Muslims from entering the US as evidence that the move was in fact designed with such a goal in mind -- and constitutional law experts agree there is a precedent for the courts taking that argument to heart.
In a case currently before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for the states of Washington and Minnesota cite previous court holdings on religious discrimination that it is ""'the duty of the courts to distinguish a sham secular purpose from a sincere one.'""
""Here, the sham of a secular purpose is exposed by both the language of the order and defendants' expressions of anti-Muslim intent,"" the lawyers wrote.
Constitutional scholars agree that those statements made by Trump and his surrogates could be used in proceedings.
""Those statements are definitely relevant, because there's a longstanding doctrine that there can be laws or executive orders that on their face don't discriminative on the basis of race or religion but that is their motive -- and if that is their motive, they can be struck down,"" said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.
""Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,"" Trump declared in December 2015.
The White House has insisted that labeling the new action as a ""Muslim ban"" is inappropriate. They point to statements from Trump later in the campaign that he wanted ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants and the fact that it's a temporary ban and only affects seven countries designated under the Obama administration as bearing extra scrutiny.
""He's also made very clear that this is not a Muslim ban, it's not a travel ban,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in the daily briefing on Tuesday. ""It's a vetting system to keep America safe.""
DHS chief defends rollout of executive order
""This is not -- I repeat -- not a ban on Muslims,"" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly repeated in a news conference Tuesday.
Giuliani's claims
Multiple lawsuits challenging the executive order are using statements from Trump and others as evidence the intent of the policy is unconstitutional. A lawsuit from the Counsel on American Islamic Relations challenges the policy on the grounds that it unconstitutionally singles out Muslims, and New York's attorney general has joined a federal lawsuit in his state making similar claims among broader constitutional arguments.
Those who insist the order is intended as a Muslim ban point to comments made by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to Fox News last week, in which he described helping Trump develop the order.
""I'll tell you the whole history of it,"" Giuliani said, as transcribed by The Washington Post. ""So when (Trump) first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.'""
Giuliani said that he pulled together a group that helped conceptualize the order. ""We focused on, instead of religion, danger -- the areas of the world that create danger for us,"" he added. ""Which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible.""
Critics of the order also point to comments Trump himself made to Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody last week that the policy would prioritize persecuted Christians in countries where Muslims would otherwise be blocked by the ban.
""As it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here?"" Brody asked, to which Trump said, ""Yes.""
""They've been horribly treated,"" Trump said. ""Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.""
The order includes a halt on refugees coming into the US from Syria, though it allows for special preference to religious minorities fleeing persecution.
Critics say those statements make clear that the order was guided by anti-Muslim sentiment.
""The vulgar animosity that accounts for the existence of Executive Order entitled 'Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals' ... is plain to see, and the absence of the words Islam or Muslim does nothing to obscure it,"" wrote CAIR's lawyers.
Intentions can matter
Constitutional law experts say, in theory, the statements could be difficult for the government to defend. Courts have long held that records about the intention of laws can be used to invalidate statutes that otherwise appear to be neutral.
The classic example is literacy tests as a condition of voting. In Guinn v. US, the Supreme Court held an Oklahoma law passed in 1910 that required literacy to vote, unless it could shown an individual's grandfather was allowed to vote, was unconstitutional because the intent was to exclude African-Americans, the vast majority of whose grandfathers would have been unable to vote.
In another case, Edwards v. Aguillard, the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that a Louisiana law requiring creationism to be taught in schools alongside evolution was unconstitutionally designed to promote religion despite the law claiming an objective of academic freedom. To reach its conclusion, the court analyzed the legislative history of the bill, including hearings conducted on its crafting.
But while experts agree the public record helps the groups challenging the order, they still face long odds.
""Certainly these comments make defending the orders more difficult for the government than they otherwise would be,"" said Michael Dorf, a law professor at Cornell University. ""Whether it's enough to ensure victory for the plaintiffs is not yet clear.""
Temple University law professor Peter Spiro wrote an op-ed when Trump first proposed a Muslim ban in 2015 that said while he disagrees with the idea, it was constitutional. He said that's probably still true of Trump's actual executive order as well, especially given the arguments that the countries affected are limited in number.
But he acknowledged that the record of comments weaken the government's case -- and he suspects that they could be introduced alongside evidence that the order isn't tailored to a clear security risk and its haphazard rollout to strengthen constitutional challenges.
""It's not too difficult to portray the policy as just being flat-out irrational, and then you can pull in the Muslim ban rhetoric by way of adding to that argument that it's irrational policy and that then has constitutional questions,"" Spiro said. ""it does add to the atmospherics here, which put this law in sort of a really bad odor, and there are lots of elements of the story that cast doubt on the efficacy of this law, the way in which it was adopted, whether it would advance any counter-terror objectives, it just all looks bad. And courts sort of assimilate those atmospherics, in ways that make them more inclined to apply greater scrutiny.""",negative

Trump's uses of presidential power on issues such as his travel ban, ordering the construction of a border wall and his threats to kill NATO are all cause for concern, according to John Yoo in a New York Times op-ed published Monday under the headline, ""Executive Power Run Amok.""
""Even Alexander Hamilton, our nation's most ardent proponent of executive power, would be worried by now,"" Yoo wrote.
Yoo worked at the Justice Department during Bush's administration, authoring memorandums on enhanced interrogation tactics also known as the "" torture memos ."" He now works as a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute -- and said he has monitored Trump's actions with concern.

Yoo said that the travel ban is constitutional, but what concerned him about it was that Rudy Giuliani ""disclosed that Mr. Trump had initially asked for 'a Muslim ban,' which would most likely violate the Constitution's protection for freedom of religion or its prohibition on the state establishment of religion, or both -- no mean feat.""
He also wrote that Trump's firing of former acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she disputed the ban ""raises concerns.""
""A successful president need not have a degree in constitutional law. But he should understand the Constitution's grant of executive power,"" he saidd.

The call also touches on the alliance's role in everything from Ukraine to the fight against terror
(CNN) Despite loudly voiced objections to its relevancy and its funding, US President Donald Trump has committed to attend a meeting of NATO leaders in Europe in May, according to the organization.
Trump, who was outspoken on the campaign trail about the role -- and upkeep -- of the security pact, spoke with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Sunday night.
During the call, the two leaders ""reconfirmed the importance of the Alliance in troubled times,"" according to a statement from NATO.
Trump and Stoltenberg specifically discussed NATO allies meeting their defense spending commitments, the role of the organization in defeating terror, and the potential for a peaceful resolution to the Ukrainian conflict.

(CNN) Pushing back on a New York Times article detailing disorder in the West Wing, press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday the reporters got their facts wrong -- including the eye-catching detail that Trump watches TV in his bathrobe.
""That story was so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the President an apology for the way that thing was written,"" he told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""There were literally blatant factual errors, and it's unacceptable to see that kind of reporting.""
He identified one detail in the piece that rang false.
""I don't think the President wears a bathrobe, and definitely doesn't own one,"" he said.

651,"Detroit (CNN) As their progressive base rages against President Donald Trump, the candidates vying to lead the Democratic Party are all abiding by a simple rule: First, do no harm.
Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, Labor Secretary Tom Perez and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are leading a race for Democratic National Committee chair that often sounds like an echo chamber.
The candidates' ideas are largely non-controversial and built mostly around a desire to do everything possible to tap into the anti-Trump progressive energy without risking damage to what many fear is still a new and fragile movement that could die out well before the next election.
Gathered over the weekend in Detroit for their third of four ""future forums"" before the party selects a new chair, it was increasingly clear that even those seeking to lead the party are still trying to figure out how to harness a movement that has gained voice and energy during Trump's first couple of weeks in office.
""A lot of what we're wrestling with in terms of a movement the likes of which we haven't seen since the '60s, and where the party fits into that, is uncharted territory, at least for our generation,"" Buttigieg said in an interview.
It is, in part, because the new DNC chair won't be installed until well after this first wave of anti-Trump activism.
The 447 DNC voting members won't select their new chair until late February in Atlanta.
At forums for DNC candidates, the same ideas -- the importance of organizing, a 50-state strategy, more funding for state parties, a focus on voting access and total deference to voters in primaries, to avoid the appearance of Hillary Clinton-over-Bernie Sanders style favoritism -- are espoused by each of the candidates.
""We ignored the basics"" in 2016, Perez said on stage in Detroit.
""We all like each other so much that whenever anyone has a great idea or a great phrase, it ends up getting incorporated into all of our speeches,"" said Sally Boynton Brown, the Idaho Democratic Party executive director and a candidate for chair. ""I think that's a problem for all of us.""
Buttigieg argued that ""people are treating things as obvious a little too soon"" -- pointing to the idea of a 50-state strategy, focusing beyond the big states, which was ""wildly controversial"" when Howard Dean first introduced it in 2005.
Tea party and town hall project
As Democrats decide on their new leader, a series of ad hoc groups have already taken on the task of organizing and channeling the protests -- mirroring the tea party, which grew outside the Republican Party establishment in 2009 and 2010 but was eventually embraced and fueled by the GOP.
Jimmy Dahman -- who spent the 2016 presidential campaign as a field organizer for Hillary Clinton in Iowa and Ohio -- recently tapped into his network of Democratic contacts to recruit an army of 100 volunteers to launch the ""Town Hall Project.""
It was a simple idea: Dahman, his volunteers and other progressives on social media would compile every Republican town hall meeting or event into one giant spreadsheet and post it online.
Inspired by the massive turnout of pro-Obamacare activists at a town hall hosted by Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado, Dahman said he believed people craved opportunities to tell their representatives face-to-face -- much as tea partiers did in 2009 -- and he wanted a way to empower them.
""I thought, 'I wonder how many people feel the same way but didn't know the event exists,'"" Dahman said. ""There's an energy there. We just want to give people something to do with it.""
He said he's heard reports of lawmakers moving their pre-planned events to larger venues.
""It's not just in these big cities or where you'd expect -- it's in swing districts. It's in safe seats,"" he said. ""What's encouraging to me is that there are so many people interested and there are groups like this popping up with regularity.""
Surprised by base's energy
In Detroit, Democrats described being astonished by the base's energy. They said they'd watched anti-Trump events posted on Facebook by people who were not already deeply connected to the party draw hundreds of attendees.
Additional new groups are taking on tasks such as training potential candidates for office. Two veteran Democratic operatives launched ""Run for Something"" -- with about 200 party professionals volunteering to help newly-engaged activists who want to get involved on the local or state level but don't know where to start.
As of Friday, the group said, 3,300 people had already signed up to run for some office.
Emily's List, which funds female Democratic candidates, held a training session the day after the Women's March in Washington for 500 women. Another 500 were on a waiting list, and the group is working to train them in follow-up sessions, too.
Outside Washington, Democratic state attorneys general are increasingly coordinating their legal battles against the Trump administration -- with figures like California Attorney General Xavier Beccera and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman expected to play increasingly prominent roles.
The super PAC Priorities USA has brought Democratic superlawyer Marc Elias onto its board and plans to focus on fighting state-level GOP efforts to restrict voting access in courts and legislatures.
Meanwhile, former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading the new National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which will similarly combat the district-drawing efforts that have helped the GOP secure its House majority.
What many Democrats hope the national party will become is something modeled after the Republican National Committee under former chairman Reince Priebus -- a Wisconsin operative whose focus on the nuts and bolts of collecting voter data, building party operations in each state and fundraising allowed the party to turn over the keys of a functional campaign to Trump once he was the nominee, rather than building that campaign from scratch, as Hillary Clinton largely did.
The DNC chair candidates argued the base's enthusiasm is only helping Democrats, even in red states, where 10 Democratic senators are up for re-election in 2018 in states Trump won.
Perez said the party is still confronting ""existential threats,"" including its loss of white voters in rural and exurban Rust Belt states.
""That's why I'm going out to rural America next week -- to Wisconsin and Kansas -- to talk to them about, what was it about our message that didn't resonate with you?"" he said. ""We have to make house calls in this job.""
Ellison said it's urgent for the party to do all it can to encourage and channel the anti-Trump protests.
""We have to understand one simple idea, and that is if you want a friend, you have to be one,"" he said.
Still, Ellison acknowledged that organizing and energy aren't enough -- the party needs money, and needs to spend it on local-level infrastructure. ""You've got to train, recruit and get some of these young people to run for office.""",positive
652,"(CNN) German magazine Der Spiegel has sparked fierce debate after depicting US President Donald Trump beheading the Statue of Liberty on its front cover.
The illustration by Edel Rodriguez, who arrived in the US as a political refugee from Cuba in 1980, has prompted both positive and negative reaction across the world.
Rodriguez's image shows a cartoon Trump holding a bloodied knife in his left hand with the statue's head in his right, while blood drips onto the floor.
The caption ""America First"" accompanies the image on the cover of the weekly magazine. Trump used the phrase as a slogan during his campaign and said in his inaugural speech: ""From this moment on, it's going to be America first.""
The magazine cover comes amid anger and protests around the world over Trump's travel ban . The controversial order banned foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, suspended all refugee entry to the country for 120 days and indefinitely suspended entry for Syrian refugees.
""It's a beheading of democracy, a beheading of a sacred symbol,"" Rodriguez told the Washington Post. He said he drew a link between ISIS and Trump, adding that ""both sides are extremists, so I'm just making a comparison between them.""
Der Spiegel's is just one of several recent controversial magazine covers to feature Trump's image.
Trump 'dividing Washington'
In an editorial on its English website , Der Spiegel editor Klaus Brinkbäumer wrote of Trump: ""With his style of rule -- his decrees, his appointments and his firings -- he is dividing Washington and the rest of the country.""
Brinkbäumer added that he believes Trump ""wants to establish an illiberal democracy, or worse; he wants to undermine the balance of power.""
The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for a comment on the image.

Reaction to the Der Spiegel cover has been mixed. Some are praising the magazine for its stance, while others such as Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, a member of Germany's Free Democrats (FDP) and vice president of the European Parliament, are calling it ""tasteless.""
It's not the first time a news outlet has published an image of Trump decapitating the Statue of Liberty. The New York Daily News published a similar illustration on its front page in 2015.
Strained US-German relations
The timing of the cover also comes amid strained relations between Berlin and Washington.
Last month, Trump accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel of making a ""catastrophic mistake"" with her open-door immigration policy.
Then last week, an adviser to Trump accused Germany of using a ""grossly undervalued"" euro to hurt the US economy, a charge that drew a fierce rebuke from Merkel.
This also is not the first time Der Spiegel has featured Trump on its front cover.

In November, it published an illustration of Trump as a meteor speeding toward Earth.
While that image attracted some attention, this latest effort by Rodriguez appears to have gone further.
He also drew a Trump illustration for the cover of Time Magazine during the 2016 campaign, without adding facial features.
""That's the way I see him,"" Rodriguez told the Washington Post . ""I see him as someone that's very angry, and it's pretty much his mouth that's moving all the time, so that's how I tend to show him in some of my work.""

Der Spiegel is among several magazines recently to use illustrations to voice opinions on Trump's policies.
The Economist also caused controversy with its front-page image of Trump throwing a Molotov cocktail along with the caption: ""An insurgent in the White House.""

""Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!"" Trump said in one message.

655,"(CNN) Three federal judges Tuesday evening will hear oral arguments in the challenge to President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration.
The hour-long hearing, conducted by telephone among three West coast judges at 6 p.m. ET, will determine the immediate fate of the nationwide temporary restraining order against Trump's travel ban.
Trump has only been in office for 17 days, but his Justice Department is already embroiled in a high-stakes legal battle that could affect hundreds of thousands of people and the direction of his presidency.
Attorneys general for Washington and Minnesota, which challenged the executive order, say that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President had ""unleashed chaos"" by signing the order.
Trump, who rode a wave of populist anger into the White House, now has to wait for the Ninth Circuit panel. The San Francisco-based court has a reputation as one of the most liberal in the nation to the point where some Republican lawmakers have even pushed to split it up in an effort to limit its impact. And no matter what its ruling here, the next stop will likely be the US Supreme Court.
It's a stunning escalation of an issue that has caused massive confusion in airports across the country, left those with valid visas and refugees seeking asylum in legal limbo and prompted the President himself -- in the first major legal challenge of his presidency -- to launch an attack on one judge who ruled against him.
Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday evening commented on Trump's attack: ""My mother and father raised me to be gracious in victory and defeat as a kid. Based on those tweets it appears to me that's a lesson that's been lost on President Trump.""
Not a constitutional challenge
The issue in front of the court at the moment is not whether or not Trump's travel ban is constitutional, but whether it will remain suspended for now.
It all centers on his executive order issued January 27 with little explanation or advance warning. The order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
Friday, federal Judge James Robart of the US District Court for the Western District of Washington suspended key parts of the executive order nationwide . Trump fired off two tweets in response . In one he referred to Robart as a ""so called"" judge. In another, he said, ""Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!""
The two states' attorneys general put forward several legal arguments, including that it violates the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment to the Constitution because it shows government preference for one religion over another, and Equal Protection Clause -- part of the 14th Amendment -- because it discriminates based on religion and national origin.
The government counters that Robart's injunction should be lifted for now and the executive order should be cleared to go back into effect while the legal process continues.
""The Executive Order is a lawful exercise of the President's authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees,"" the lawyers wrote in briefs filed Monday night. They argued that the district court ""erred"" in entering a ""sweeping nationwide injunction.""
They argued that Congress has granted the President ""broad discretion"" to suspend ""any class of aliens"" into the United States.
But they acknowledged that if the Court were to allow the injunction to stand it should be limited to the class of individuals on whom the State's claims rest: ""previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.""
Amicus brief from Kerry, Albright
Also on Monday morning several former senior US officials, including former Secretaries of State John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, signed on to a declaration in support of a brief filed by the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota.
""We view the (Executive) Order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,"" officials wrote.
""It could do long-term damage to our national security and foreign policy interest, endangering US troops in the field and disrupting counterterrorism and national security partnerships.""
Amicus brief from 16 state attorneys general
The top legal officials in 16 states, including Pennsylvania and Iowa which voted for Trump, filed a memorandum in support of efforts to halt the travel ban . The state attorneys general from these states argue they have standing as the executive order inflicts harm on states, including disruption at state universities and medical institutions.
The states include New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont, the Commonwealths of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia.
Government briefs due Monday evening
The appellate court has been burning the midnight oil, requesting further briefing early Sunday on the Justice Department's request for an emergency stay from the two states -- Washington and Minnesota -- as well as from the government.
The states ask that the court to leave the temporary restraining order in place, arguing that the government has failed to show that it would be ""irreparably harmed"" by a suspension of the executive order.
""But that would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued, Defendants were suffering some unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. That makes no sense. ... Preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties,"" the states said in a court filing Monday morning.
Monday evening, the Justice Department responded.
""The Executive Order is a lawful exercise of the President's authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees,"" the Justice Department wrote in a brief Monday evening.
Ferguson responded to the filing saying: ""There's nothing in there that's particularly surprising.""
JUST WATCHED Executive orders: One thing you need to know Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Executive orders: One thing you need to know 00:53
The government struck back Sunday, arguing that Robart's order should be lifted and the executive order go back into effect. ""Judicial second-guessing of the President's determination that a temporary suspension of entry of certain classes of aliens was necessary at this time to protect national security would constitute an impermissible intrusion on the political branches' plenary constitutional authority over foreign affairs, national security, and immigration,"" wrote Noel Francisco, the acting Solicitor General.
The three-judge panel includes Judge William C. Canby Jr, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, and Judge Richard R. Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush. It is likely that they will make their decisions based on the legal briefs they receive and not ask for a hearing.
The 9th Circuit represents the most geographically diverse district in the country with nearly four dozen judges and covers most of the western United States, Hawaii and Alaska.
The loser at the 9th Circuit will most likely go to the Supreme Court. Because the justices are understaffed with only eight judges, there is a chance that they could split on the ruling 4-4.
If that were to occur, they'd be left with simply upholding whatever order the 9th Circuit issued, underscoring the importance of that court's ruling.
Hawaii rejected
Hawaii had filed an emergency motion to intervene in the appeal as well alongside Minnesota and Washington, an attempt the court rejected Monday night.
The state's attorney general filed a separate lawsuit against Trump over the travel ban in federal district court in Hawaii last week, and it argued that Hawaii must be allowed in the case before the Ninth Circuit to protect its interests as well.",negative

658,"Many Americans are up in arms. But in fact, keeping out desperate souls seeking entry into America has deep roots. On this day 100 years ago, the United States passed the strictest immigration law of its time: the Immigration Act of 1917.
The law restricted the immigration of ""undesirables,"" including many people from the Middle East and Asia, through increased taxes, tests and outright bans.
Trump's ban, which has prompted nationwide protests and widespread condemnation , is eerily similar -- targeting some of the same people and imposing tests in the form of ""extreme vetting,"" according to observers.
""In some ways this is kind of back to the future,"" said Kevin Johnson, an immigration law expert and dean at the UC Davis School of Law.
What was the Immigration Act of 1917?
The Immigration Act barred an ambiguous and long list of people from entering the country.
According to the law, these included ""all idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, epileptics, insane persons ... persons with chronic alcoholism; paupers, professional beggars,"" and those with tuberculosis and other contagious diseases. It barred felons, polygamists, prostitutes and their traffickers, and -- similar to Trump's ban -- it blocked entry to those who ""advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States, or of all forms of law"" and anyone who would ""advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety"" of killing of US officers or officials.
To keep these people out, the law raised the tax imposed on most adult entrants. It also imposed a literacy test, requiring newcomers older than 16 to demonstrate basic reading comprehension in any language.
US inspectors examine the eyes of immigrants at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, in the early 1900s.
Moreover, the law kept out people from what it called the ""Asiatic Barred Zone,"" which included modern day India, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Southeast Asia and the Asian-Pacific islands.
China was not included, but the Chinese were already denied immigration visas under the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act -- which became more discriminatory over the years until it was repealed in 1943 after Beijing became a World War II ally.
Exempt were Japan and the Philippines. The former had voluntarily limited its peoples' immigration to the United States in 1907. The latter was a US colony at the time.
Who supported the law and why?
US lawmakers who drafted and passed the immigration law characterized it as necessary for the country's security. With World War I in full swing, the issue of national security was on everyone's mind.

""There was domestic anxiety and uncertainty and frustration and the Soviet Union was being formed,"" said Johnson, author of ""The Huddled Masses Myth: Immigration And Civil Rights.""
""There was a Red Scare on the horizon. There were political tensions. There was a concern with widespread immigration.""
The State Department's Office of the Historian adds: ""The uncertainty generated over national security during World War I made it possible for Congress to pass this legislation.""
Domestically, Johnson said the law was fairly popular.
""In 1917, segregation and Jim Crow is alive and well and keeping out Chinese from the country and all Asians seems as normal and natural as apple pie,"" he said.
What did critics say?
The immigration law did not pass unopposed. In fact, it was vetoed by President Woodrow Wilson, but Congress overrode the veto.
Wilson argued that the law contradicted US values and prevented good people from joining American society.
The Immigration Act of 1917 was vetoed by President Woodrow Wilson.
In vetoing an earlier version of the act , Wilson said it would ""all but close entirely the gates of asylum which have always been open to those who could find nowhere else the right and opportunity of constitutional agitation for what they conceived to be the natural and inalienable rights of men.""
""Restrictions like these, adopted earlier in our history as a Nation, would very materially have altered the course and cooled the humane ardors of our politics,"" he wrote.
""The right of political asylum has brought to this country many a man of noble character and elevated purpose who was marked as an outlaw in his own less fortunate land, and who has yet become an ornament to our citizenship and to our public councils.""
International reaction to the law was also harsh, with many of the named countries condemning the law, Johnson said.
How is Trump's immigration ban similar?
JUST WATCHED Trump: We don't want them here Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: We don't want them here 02:50
On January 27, Trump signed an executive order that suspended immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days, halted the US refugee program for 120 days and indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the United States.
""I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry,"" Trump's order reads. Other countries impacted included Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.
The order also instituted screening tests on refugees and immigrants to see if they held American values. The President has described the process as "" extreme vetting .""
""I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,"" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. ""We don't want them here.""
The total number of refugees admitted into the United States was also capped during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000.
The order followed Trump's campaign promise to tighten borders and stop certain refugees from entering the United States.
Although the the Immigration Act of 1917 is more far-reaching than Trump's order, observers say they're similar in at least three ways: First, supporters of both argued the restrictions were necessary for national security. Second, the restrictions imposed a type of test. Third, the bans seemingly discriminate against people based on their national origin.
What was the impact?
It's difficult to quantify the impact of immigration bans . When refugees and immigrants are barred from entering countries, persecuted people cannot escape danger and may be harmed or killed, families are separated , opportunities are lost and finances spent on travel are squandered. Host countries may also lose out on labor, knowledge and expertise that could potentially strengthen their societies and economies.
In fact, the Immigration Act of 1917 was challenged by businesses in the Southwest that said literacy tests barred much-needed Mexican laborers from entering the country.
Trump's executive order banning certain immigrants also risked preventing students from finishing academic programs and doctors from returning to their jobs in American hospitals . It also prevented sick people from receiving life-saving treatment.
Iranian infant Fatemeh Reshand , for example, almost missed the opportunity to receive medical treatment for a serious heart defect. It took much lobbying from family members and community leaders to grant her and her parents a medical exemption.

Where do these laws stand now?
The Immigration Act of 1917 was revised by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act. The law abolished racial restrictions but retained quotas for nationalities and regions. It also established a preference system that placed higher value on some nationalities and immigrants with specific labor skills.
As for Trump's executive order on immigration, it was temporarily halted Friday by a federal judge. The Department of Homeland Security then suspended implementation of the order, saying it would resume standard inspections of travelers as it did prior to the ban.",negative
659,"Story highlights ""This sort of thing is handled at the state level,"" McConnell said
""Election fraud does occur,"" he said
Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday no federal money should be spent investigating voter fraud -- which President Donald Trump has falsely claimed cost him millions of votes.
McConnell told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" he wants to leave the task of wiping voters who have died or moved away off their rolls to state governments.
""This sort of thing is handled at the state level, and the Democrats always claim there's no election fraud at all. That is, of course, not true -- election fraud does occur. There's no evidence that it occurred in such a significant number that would have changed the presidential election, and I don't think we ought to spend any federal money investigating that,"" the Kentucky Republican said.
Trump has asserted, without providing any evidence, that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton in 2016 -- similar to the margin of Clinton's popular vote victory over Trump.
He said he would launch a federal investigation into voter fraud. But the White House canceled an event where Trump was scheduled to take executive action ordering such an investigation more than a week ago and has not rescheduled.

662,"Story highlights Trump's order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries
A state has to prove that it has been harmed in order to bring the challenge
(CNN) Top Justice Department lawyers are now in charge of defending the Trump administration's hastily drawn up executive order, and they are assiduously avoiding President Donald Trump's blunt and inflammatory tweets in favor of sweeping and bold statements about national security and executive power.
In their first full-throated defense of the executive order, the lawyers argue that a lower court's injunction ""contravenes the constitutional separation of powers ... harms the public by thwarting"" enforcement of the order, and ""second-guesses"" the President's judgment about the ""quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens.""
Trump's order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
Since the federal appeals court rejected a request to immediately reinstate the travel ban, lawyers for Washington state and Minnesota have until 2:59 a.m. Monday to file legal papers, and the Justice Department lawyers have until 6 p.m. Monday evening to reply. Then a three-judge panel will decide whether to schedule a hearing or issue a ruling.
Justice Department lawyers face an uphill battle to vacate the lower court's order, but in making their arguments, they've laid out a broad defense that will replay in other upcoming challenges.

663,"Washington (CNN) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders accused President Donald Trump of falling short of commitments to middle-class voters, pointing to his Cabinet and senior advisers' ties to Wall Street.
""This guy is a fraud,"" Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday.
""This guy ran for president of the United States saying, 'I, Donald Trump, I'm going to take on Wall Street -- these guys are getting away with murder.' Then suddenly, he appoints all these billionaires,"" Sanders said.
Trump selected Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs trader and hedge fund manager, as his treasury secretary nominee; Wilbur Ross, a billionaire former banker, to lead the Commerce Department; and Gary Cohn, a top Goldman Sachs executive, to lead his National Economic Council
Sanders said Trump's Cabinet appointments and advisers directly contradict his pledge to re-institute the Glass-Steagall Act, a regulation that separated commercial and investment banks, which was repealed under Bill Clinton.
Trump signed an executive order on Friday that sets the stage for rewriting US financial regulation in an effort to encourage more lending to American businesses.
he White House also signaled a possible shake-up of the structure of financial regulators, especially the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Trump wrote that regulation must ""restore public accountability,"" a backhand reference the CFPB, which some Republicans have painted as a rogue regulator that lacks oversight.
""He is a good showman, I will give you that -- he is a good TV guy,"" Sanders said of Trump. ""But I think he is going to sell out the middle class, the working class, of this country.""

664,"(CNN) Protests against President Donald Trump's policies took place Saturday in several major American cities.
Though not on the scale of last weekend's protests, demonstrators gathered in cities such as Denver, Houston, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Washington.
A protest also took place in West Palm Beach, Florida, close to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, where he is spending the weekend.
There were a variety of themes at the protests. Some people voiced objection to the President's proposed border wall. In other places people spoke out for rights for refugees, immigrants and LGBT Americans.
The gatherings took place one day after a federal judge in Washington state issued a temporary stay on the President's immigration ban executive order.
The White House quickly responded in a statement, saying the Justice Department will fight to block the order ""at the earliest possible time.""
Here is what was happened around the nation Saturday.
Washington
Protesters walked along Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to the US Capitol to ""deliver a clear message to the doorsteps of President Trump, members of Congress, and the courts,"" according to a Facebook event page.
At the front of the pack, participants held a banner across the front row saying, ""No Ban,"" referring Trump's January 29 executive order that temporarily bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.

Demonstrators also stopped outside the new hotel owned by the Trump family before moving on.
Ramin Mehdizadeh, an Iranian who founded an architectural firm in Washington, told CNN he is worried his parents in Iran won't be able to come to the United States to see their grandchildren. He is also concerned that something would happen if he went overseas and tried to return.
""I have a life here. I have a business here. It is so scary,"" he said.
Christine Montgomery, born and raised in the capital, said many immigrants marched alongside her African-American family and friends in the Washington ""Black Lives Matter"" protests.
""Before, they were sympathizing with us. Now they're empathizing with us, "" she said.
Melissa Jackson agreed, saying Trump is ironically uniting Americans with his executive orders.
""With him in office, he's really bringing this country together,"" she said, pointing to the crowd's diversity.
New York
The LGBT community and supporters rallied at Stonewall National Monument to speak out against Donald Trump.
CNN affiliate WABC reported thousands of people congregated in Greenwich Village at the Stonewall National Monument , voicing opposition to the stances of the White House on LGBT issues.
Four arrests were made on Saturday during the protests, the NYPD told CNN.
Stonewall was the country's first national monument honoring the LGBT movement. WABC reported organizers called for a rally when a draft of an executive order circulated this week that would have curbed LGBT rights.
""This is an unpredictable White House that makes very erratic policy decisions ... so we believe we have to be out in front of these fights,"" said Zeke Stokes, vice president of programs for GLAAD, an LGBT activist group.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke at the rally, leading several ""Dump Trump"" chants.
Protesters also spoke out for other groups that they believe are being discriminated against.
""As a member of the LGBT community, I'm here to say that whether you are Muslim, whether you are Latino or Latina, an immigrant or a refugee or anybody else whose been antagonized by this demagogic tyrant, we have your back,"" said New York City Councilman Corey Johnson. ""We have the responsibility to look out for each other.""
West Palm Beach
A sizable crowd stretched a mile down the sidewalk on Flagler Drive as thousands of people walked towards President Trump's weekend residence.
Across the water, the lights of Mar-a-Lago seemed to be off. Later, fireworks went off above the club, likely at the end of a fundraiser being held.
On the West Palm Beach side, a few dozen pro-Trump counterprotesters showed up and at one point there was a tense moment when a man got out of a pickup with a Trump flag. When there was a physical altercation, police moved in. It did not appear that anyone was detained.
Some marchers went across the bridge and stood on the road across from the club, where a Red Cross Ball was being held. After staying there for a few hours, the protesters went home.
But before departing, they sang the Star-Spangled Banner and chanted, ""U-S-A!"" One man yelled ""Hey, we are all on the same team.""
Trump supporters heckled marchers, saying, ""This is your president.""
Miami
""No ban, no wall,"" protesters said as they walked through Miami to the Miami-Dade County courthouse, CNN affiliate WPLG reported. Miami police kept an eye on the marchers, occasionally stopping traffic so the scores of people could continue through intersections.
At the courthouse, the protesters almost filled the steps to the building.

A few counterprotesters held signs saying, ""BlacksForTrump2020.com,"" a reporter for the Houston Chronicle tweeted.
They were far outnumbered by the crowd of several hundred.
The city is teeming with people there to watch the Super Bowl, and according to CNN affiliate KTRK, protests there didn't cause any issues.

665,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump spent months running against Barack Obama's leadership style, faulting him for being ""weak and ineffective"" on Iran, lacking of focus the ""real"" job numbers and inability to combat ISIS because he was the group's ""founder.""
What a difference a few months makes.
Trump and his White House advisers are now using Obama as a security blanket, making almost identical moves he made during his tenure and defending possible mistakes by arguing that they were initially made by Barack Obama.
The tactic is familiar: Obama, eight years after he succeeded President George W. Bush, was still blaming the 43rd president for some of the pockmarks on his legacy.
But what is remarkable about Trump is how vehemently he ran against Obama. Not only did Trump describe the Obama presidency in near apocalyptic terms during the campaign, he was the leader of the ""Birther"" movement, an attempt to delegitimize the president he is now using as a shield.
In the aftermath this week of the botched raid in Yemen that left one US Navy SEAL dead and three more wounded, as well as another three hurt in an Osprey crash, the Trump White House pointed the finger at the previous administration.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer, laying out how the raid came together, was clear to note that it was approved by the Obama administration before it was passed off and approved by Trump.
""Clearly, that was under the last administration,"" Spicer said while going through the key dates in the raid. And White House officials, speaking with the benefit of not identifying themselves, were quick to note that Pentagon officials had discussed and even signed off on the plan.
This has Obama allies accusing the new commander in chief of passing the buck.
Ned Price, former special assistant to Obama and the National Security Council, tweeted Thursday that the operation was ""never presented to or considered by the Obama Admin for approval.""
Except it was misleading. The specific operation in question was never presented to or considered by the Obama Admin for approval. https://t.co/v0KwnhhRj9 — Ned Price (@nedprice) February 2, 2017
Another former senior government official involved in Obama's National Security Council told CNN: ""In a nutshell, Trump and his team owns the process and the ultimate decision -- and the consequences.""
Viewing jobs numbers in new light
Obama's team is also wondering why Trump, who repeatedly criticized the unemployment figures issued under the Democratic president, is suddenly taking credit for new job growth at the end of Obama's term.
The unemployment rate hovered between 4.7% and 5% for all of last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , but Trump told voters they weren't real.
""Don't believe these phony numbers,"" Trump said in February 2016. ""The number is probably 28, 29, as high as 35 [percent]. In fact, I even heard recently 42%.""
Friday, when the latest numbers were released, Spicer touted the figures from the White House podium.
""Speaking of good numbers,"" Spicer said before reading out the January jobs report that found America added 227,000 jobs in January, well ahead of December's gain of 157,000 jobs.
""Today's report reflects the consumer confidence that the Trump presidency has inspired,"" Spicer said. Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump's top aides, tweeted that ""jobs numbers already like POTUS.""
Trump, during a meeting with business leaders on Friday, said he was ""very happy"" with the jobs report.
""I think that' it's going to continue big league. We're bringing back jobs,"" he added.
While this is the first jobs report released under Trump, the Labor Department conducted the survey in the second week of January, while Obama was still in office.
And Obama officials -- many of whom left their offices weeks ago -- were left to laugh at how Trump is taking credit for the jobs numbers.
""It was, indeed, remarkable that the unemployment rate fell from 42% to 4.8% on January 20th,"" said Austan Goolsbee, the former chair of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.
Same Iran sanctions policy as Obama's?
And on Iran, Trump is responding to the nation's ballistic missile test in nearly the same way Obama's administration responded.
After Trump's national security adviser puts Iran ""on notice,"" the Trump administration announced it was applying sanctions on 25 individuals and companies connected to Iran's ballistic missile program.
""Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how ""kind"" President Obama was to them,"" Trump tweeted on Friday. ""Not me!""
Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how ""kind"" President Obama was to them. Not me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017
National Security Adviser Michael Flynn said in a statement that the sanctions show ""the days of turning a blind eye to Iran's hostile and belligerent actions toward the United States and the world community are over.""
Responding to the Iranian's testing ballistic missiles by implanting sanctions, however, is exactly what the Obama administration did in January 2016.
""We will continue to enforce these sanctions vigorously,"" Obama said when his Treasury Department sanctioned 11 people with ties to the missile program. ""We are going to remain vigilant about it.""
Jake Sullivan, the top policy adviser on Hillary Clinton's campaign and a former Obama administration official, said Thursday that Trump took a page out of Obama's playbook.
""When the Iranians tested Ballistic Missiles in the Obama administration, the Obama administration imposed sanctions,"" Sullivan said. ""So, this is consistent with steps that have been taken in the past.""",negative

A week ago, President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending resettlement for 120 days and initiating a review of the vetting procedures used to approve applicants to come to the United States.
Then Friday, a more welcome surprise for refugee groups: A federal judge in Washington reversed several key provisions of the executive order, paving the way some refugees to enter the country.

668,"Washington (CNN) The rapid halting of President Donald Trump's immigration order has given him his first exposure to the limits on his presidential power, a sharp awakening for a real estate mogul accustomed to the wide unilateral prerogative of a chief executive.
With the order mired in legal challenge and travelers again weighed with uncertainty, Trump is facing his first run-in with a system of federal checks and balances.
The fresh uncertainty over the order illustrated again the chaotic fallout of the new President's intent in rapidly fulfilling his most controversial campaign promises.
And for the second Saturday in a row, airlines, travelers, and government lawyers are confronting a broad shift in the rules governing US immigration, sowing further global confusion about the President's travel ban meant to combat terror.
Aides scramble
Trump was mingling among guests in the living room of his lavish Florida estate on Friday when a judge in Washington state halted enforcement of his executive order, which he signed last Friday at the Pentagon.
His core team of advisers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon and his top policy aide Stephen Miller, had all made the journey with him to Palm Beach on Air Force One, where he's spending the weekend at his Italianate Mar-a-Lago club. The group triaged the judge's ruling from there.
Back in Washington, Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, issued a statement around 10 p.m. ET Friday night announcing the Justice Department intended to ""file an emergency stay of this outrageous order and defend the executive order of the President."" He updated his language moments later to remove the word ""outrageous.""
But if the White House was hoping to temper its language around the legal challenge, the President himself dashed any hope of decorum when he woke up at his oceanfront retreat on Saturday.
""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.

Drafted by a small circle of aides, who kept the contents secret from lawmakers and most government officials, the contentious ban has drawn legal scrutiny since it went into effect last weekend. At the Justice Department, the acting attorney general was fired from her post on Monday night after telling agency lawyers not to defend the measure. Trump replaced her with a US attorney who vowed to enforce the ban.
But with the judge's ruling on Friday evening, even Trump's own appointees will be forced to follow the court's order. Less than three hours after the decision was handed down, Customs and Border Protection officials told representatives from major air carriers they could allow previously banned passengers to board flights bound for the US.
The Department of Homeland Security, headed by Trump pick John Kelly, said it is suspending implementation of the order, even as it insisted the ban was ""lawful and appropriate.""

And the State Department, run by Trump appointee Rex Tillerson, said it is revalidating visas it revoked only days ago.
""We have reversed the provisional revocation of visas under Executive Order 13769,"" an agency official said. ""Those individuals with visas that were not physically cancelled may now travel if the visa is otherwise valid.""
The order and its subsequent reversal have led to rapid-fire changes in US policy, leading some to view a government in disarray.
""I cannot remember a president who has had so much chaos surrounding his presidency in the first 100 days,"" said David Gergen, a White House adviser to four presidents and now CNN senior political analyst. ""I understand they were trying to address a serious concern they had. They brought this on themselves the way they drafted this. They didn't have the lawyers. They need to vet this in a way to pass constitutional muster.""
Impact on Gorsuch nomination
The latest legal controversy -- and Trump's highly unusual step for a President of personally attacking a judge who delivered a ruling critical of his administration -- could spark new controversy and ammunition for Democrats in the fight against his nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made clear on Saturday that the President's tweet branding Judge James Robart as a ""so-called judge"" would prompt difficult questions for Gorsuch at his confirmation hearing.
""The President's attack on Judge James Robart, a Bush appointee who passed with 99 votes, shows a disdain for an independent judiciary that doesn't always bend to his wishes and a continued lack of respect for the Constitution, making it more important that the Supreme Court serve as an independent check on the administration,"" Schumer said in a statement.

But Vice President Mike Pence made clear in a speech to the Federalist Society in Philadelphia on Saturday that the White House would respond to any attempt to use the Senate filibuster to block Gorsuch's nomination by urging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to enact the so-called nuclear option to change the chamber's rules to allow GOP senators to schedule a vote on his nomination with a simple majority.
Still, the likelihood that the tussle over the legality of Trump's executive order sooner or later ends up in the Supreme Court gives Democrats a fresh rationale to do everything possible to delay his confirmation, given that the Supreme Court, currently operating one justice short, may not be able to amass a majority in support of the President's move.
Airlines adjust
Just as they did last Saturday as the order went into effect, airlines are adjusting their procedures for allowing passengers onto planes bound for American airports, and travelers who were previously banned are assessing whether to again attempt travel to the US.
Opponents of the ban said they were heartened by the reversal. But there remained little certitude for US policy going forward.
""Our concern is for the welfare and safety of those vulnerable refugees who believed they were escaping danger and the indignity of their lives to be resettled in the US -only to have their hopes curtailed,"" said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. ""Until there is further clarity, we would not wish to see the hopes of refugees raised only to be subsequently disappointed.""
At the Dubai International Airport, passengers boarding flights reported business as usual, as calm lines formed at counters in the terminal where US-bound planes depart. Passengers at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport and London Heathrow reported similar scenes.
Major airlines — including Qatar Airways, Lufthansa, and Air France — said on Saturday they would begin boarding passengers who were barred from entering the US under the executive order.
Emirates, the Dubai-based long-haul carrier, said it would board all passengers carrying valid US visas or green cards and allow them to fly to the US, including nationals from the seven countries that Trump's order had barred.
But the airline warned that ""entry requirements to the US may change.""",negative
669,"Washington (CNN) As challenges to President Donald Trump's travel ban ping pong through federal courts across the country, both sides are still fighting on a preliminary issue: whether the order should be temporarily blocked, and if so, where.
Legal filings hint at the broad constitutional and statutory arguments to come, but judges have not yet ruled squarely on the merits one way or the other.
The challenges began a week ago when individuals with valid visas, among others, found themselves in legal limbo. They were in transit when Trump's order went into effect on the evening of January 27 and they were not immediately allowed into the country.
Now several states are also bringing claims, including Washington, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Hawaii among others.
The claim brought by attorneys general in Washington and Minnesota -- the one that led federal Judge James Robart in Seattle to put a temporary nationwide halt to the travel ban Friday night -- is the furthest along so far, but the legal landscape changes quickly.
Trump's order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
Standing
In order to bring suit, states must prove that they have been harmed.
In court papers, attorneys general for Washington and Minnesota argue they have the legal right to be in court.
""Washington has declared that practices that discriminate against any of its inhabitants because of race, creed, color or national origin are matters of public concern that threaten the rights and proper privileges of the State and harm the public welfare,"" they wrote. They also claim the executive order would hurt the state's economy, pointing to Microsoft, which is headquartered in the state.
""Microsoft's US workforce is heavily dependent on immigrants and guest workers,"" they write. ""At least 76 employees at Microsoft are citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya or Yemen and hold temporary work visas.""
Minnesota stresses that the order would impact the Mayo Clinic that is based there.
""The Mayo Clinic, an internationally known health care institution that treats patients who travel to it for health care services from around the world, has publicly stated that approximately 80 staff, physicians and scholars have ties to the affected countries.""
The government says the states don't have the right to be in court, and on the threshold issue, government lawyers say the states are attempting to manufacture standing.
In court papers, lawyers for the government argue that ""lost tax revenues, or reputational injury to its universities -- are not concrete, particularized harms.""
And the lawyers say that the states can't rely on any injuries to lawful permanent residents because the White House has clarified that the 90-day suspension of entry does not apply to those individuals.
""In effect, the states are arguing that, unlike individuals temporarily detained at the airport, they will suffer a longer-term economic injury from the executive order -- one that therefore allows them to challenge it,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law.
""This is a controversial argument, but, more than a little ironically, it's based on similar reasoning to what a number of more conservative states, led by Texas, successfully used in the lower courts to challenge President Obama's deferred action immigration program,"" he said.
Constitutional and statutory arguments
Moving to the merits, the states make a variety of statutory and constitutional arguments.
Washington and Minnesota argue that the executive orders ""target individuals for discriminatory treatment based on their country of origin and/or religion, without lawful justification"" and they say the order was ""motivated by animus and a desire to harm a particular group.""
They also say that the order violates the Establishment Clause that prohibits the federal government from preferring one religion over another. They say parts of the order, coupled with some statements made by the President in the press, ""are intended to disfavor Islam and favor Christianity.""
And they make a due process claim arguing that the federal government cannot deprive individuals based on their liberty interests without due process of the law.
Also in play is the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which they argue ""prohibits discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas on the basis of race, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.""
Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin echoed these arguments in a different case.
He argues the executive order ""is subjecting a portion of Hawaii's population to discrimination and second-class treatment, and denying them their fundamental right to travel overseas. Moreover, the executive order is eroding Hawaii's sovereign interests in maintaining the separation between church and state and in welcoming persons from all nations around the world into the fabric of its society.""
""There are so many different legal objections to the executive order -- and so many different changes in policy in the order -- that it's hard to know which ones will stick,"" said Vladeck.
""The whole order is potentially vulnerable to the religious discrimination claims, whereas the due process objections are more to how individual sections of the order restrict the liberty of different classes of immigrants. But there's almost no way the entire order survives these lawsuits unscathed,"" he said.
In the hours after Robart issued the nationwide order blocking the ban, Trump was quick to respond.
""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"" Trump tweeted Saturday morning.
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017
In court papers, his lawyers have so far been more measured.
On the merits, they note that Congress ""expressly has delegated to the President the broad power to suspend entry 'of any class of aliens into the United States.' ""
""The order was well within the President's authority under Congress' delegation, particularly in an area, like immigration, in which the admission to the United States of foreign aliens is subject to plenary control by the political branches,"" they said.
Courts
In issuing his temporary restraining order, Robart, the US district judge for the western district of Washington, acknowledged that issuing it is ""an extraordinary remedy"" but he held that the executive order ""adversely affects the states' residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom of travel.""
He said the harms are ""significant and ongoing,"" and concluded that the order against the government was necessary until the court could hear arguments for further relief.
His order came after a different judge in Massachusetts declined to renew a temporary restraining order previously issued. Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts said one of the factors he had to consider was whether the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits.
""Because plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, an extension of the restraining order at the present time is not warranted,"" he said.",negative
670,"(CNN) President Donald Trump on Saturday again attacked a federal judge whose decision he disliked, blasting Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee who temporarily stopped his controversial travel ban Friday night.
Trump's increasingly heated responses quickly drew objections from Democrats, who said he was improperly attacking an independent judiciary. By Saturday afternoon, Trump had stepped up his criticism: ""Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision.""
Shortly after 8 a.m. ET, the President tweeted, ""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned.""
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!
That tweet was one of several Trump issued Saturday morning in which he defended his executive order on immigration, which bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
""When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble,"" Trump next tweeted.

And he was still tweeting about it early Saturday evening: ""Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?""
Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017
Trump was referring to a decision by a federal judge in Boston earlier Friday, a more limited ruling that declined to renew a temporary restraining order in Massachusetts. It would have prohibited the detention or removal of foreign travelers legally authorized to come to the Boston area, and the decision represented the Trump administration's first court victory regarding the order.
Unusual criticism
It is highly unusual for a President to publicly criticize a federal judge, but during the campaign, Trump memorably railed against Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University. Trump said Curiel, who was born in Indiana, was unable to fairly preside over the lawsuit because of his ""Mexican heritage."" Trump had introduced plans to build a wall along the Mexican border and take a hard stance on immigration.
Vice President Mike Pence later defended Trump in an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos.
""Is it right for the President to say 'so-called' judge'? Doesn't that undermine the separation of powers in the Constitution?"" Stephanopoulos asked Pence on ""This Week"" in a clip released Saturday afternoon.
""I don't think it does,"" Pence replied. ""I think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them.""
But Democrats pounced on Trump's criticism of Robart, with Democratic senators flatly saying the President's comments will factor into the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.
""Attack on federal judge from POTUS is beneath the dignity of that office. That attitude can lead America to calamity,"" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee tweeted Saturday.
Attack on federal judge from POTUS is beneath the dignity of that office. That attitude can lead America to calamity. — Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) February 4, 2017
""The President's attack on Judge James Robart, a Bush appointee who passed with 99 votes, shows a disdain for an independent judiciary that doesn't always bend to his wishes and a continued lack of respect for the Constitution, making it more important that the Supreme Court serve as an independent check on the administration,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
""With each action testing the Constitution, and each personal attack on a judge, President Trump raises the bar even higher for Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Supreme Court. His ability to be an independent check will be front and center throughout the confirmation process.""
Vermont. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said Trump's ""hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous.""
""We need a nominee for the Supreme Court willing to demonstrate he or she will not cower to an overreaching executive. This makes it even more important that Judge Gorsuch, and every other judge this president may nominate, demonstrates the ability to be an independent check and balance on an administration that shamefully and harmfully seems to reject the very concept.""
Robart's order on Friday was a significant setback to Trump's ban and set up the nation for a second straight weekend of confusion about the policy's legality.
The White House said Friday the Department of Justice will challenge the decision. In a statement, White House press secretary Sean Spicer initially called Robart's order ""outrageous"" before quickly issuing another statement that dropped that word.

671,"Detroit (CNN) Gobsmacked by their base's ferocious rejection of Donald Trump's presidency, the candidates to chair the Democratic Party scrambled Saturday to show how devoted they are to the cause.
Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez bragged to the Democratic National Committee's ""future forum"" about racing to airport protests in Houston and then San Francisco. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, made sure everyone knew he was the only one to skip David Brock's donor summit to participate in the Women's March in Washington.
Put him in charge, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison pledged, and ""We will be asking Democrats all over the country, 'Bring coffee to the marches. Be in the marches yourself. Carry a sign.' ""
As for those white rural and exurban voters who so brutally rejected Democrats in November -- well, bringing them back into the fold is also a priority for those vying to lead the party.
If the base allows it.
After three weeks of anti-Trump protests, Democrats are still stunned by the sudden burst of energy. The party's organs are all racing to keep up as dozens of events pop up -- often on Facebook, without any party chapter or progressive organization's involvement at all -- each weekend.
""The activism of people who are concerned about the Trump administration's threat to the country is very energizing to us,"" said US Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee and one of the swing-state senators up for re-election in 2018. ""We don't view that as threatening -- we love the energy.""
The energy, though, is all rooted in ferocious opposition to Trump -- the same strategy that failed Hillary Clinton in 2016.
That reality has some Democrats on Capitol Hill fretting that the rising anti-Trump fervor is putting the party at risk of papering over the same problems with voters in rural and exurban America they woke up with on November 9.
""If you can't get them back to where they're looking and thinking, 'The Democratic Party still represents me,' then you'll always be in the minority,"" said US Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia.
""The anger that people feel is righteous and justified, but it can't just be a party against Mr. Trump,"" said US Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia.
""I understand the righteous anger against some of the President's policies, but we also need to lay out a narrative that's more than just a series of position papers -- that gives us an overarching theme,"" Warner said. ""And that's what I'm looking for.""
The 2018 map vs. the base's demands
Manchin and nine other Senate Democrats are up for re-election in 2018 in states that Trump won.
Four of those Democrats -- Indiana's Joe Donnelly, Missouri's Claire McCaskill, North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp and Montana's Jon Tester -- are in states where Trump crushed Clinton.
Just how much latitude those senators need -- and should be given by the base on votes like Cabinet and Supreme Court confirmations -- is the challenge confronting Democrats now, as the party frantically searches for ways to protect those red-state Democrats without jeopardizing the base's energy and enthusiasm.
Meanwhile, much of the base is demanding total opposition to Trump -- no matter the political costs for Democrats in red states.
And there are no sacred cows, as US Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, learned when she voted in committee to confirm Ben Carson for Housing and Urban Development secretary. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, was the target of protective protesters who recently marched to his home, chanting an expletive that rhymed with his first name.
These progressives see the party's future in energizing women, minorities and young people in cities and suburbs -- particularly in Sun Belt states, including Georgia and Arizona.
""Those working-class white voters aren't the future of the party,"" said Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the liberal blog DailyKos.com, which has already raised $400,000 for a Democratic candidate in the expected runoff for the US House seat in Georgia soon to be vacated by Tom Price, Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary.
""Most of them are stuck in fake-news land anyway, and no amount of reality will penetrate that bubble. They think 1.5 million people attended Trump's inauguration. They think Obama only needed 50 votes to pass his Supreme Court nominees,"" Moulitsas said. ""They're lost. It's a waste of time to try and win them back when there are so many core-Democratic-base who didn't register or vote last cycle. Almost half the country didn't vote, and the bulk of the non-voters were liberal-leaning people many of them now marching in the streets.
""So instead of trying to chase people trapped by Breitbart and its cohorts in conservative media, give them a reason to get excited about rallying around Democrats,"" he said.
Alternate political universes
Democrats' short-term fate, though, rests in part on whether the party can hold onto Senate seats in Trump states.
In those areas, senators are struggling to wrap their minds around the alternate universes of the Trump presidency so far.
In one -- where the women's marches, airport protests and pro-Obamacare town hall turnout are the dominant storylines and former alt-right Breitbart news executive Steve Bannon is seen as a shadow president -- Trump has walked himself into repeated controversies and revealed himself to be just what the Clinton campaign warned he was.
In another -- where rural and exurban voters with little economic opportunity sought to send someone to shake up a political world they thought had lost touch with their needs -- Trump has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, jumpstarted the Keystone pipeline, taken steps toward renegotiating other trade deals, hosted top labor union leaders at the White House and is fulfilling some of his top campaign promises.
""You folks have been terrific to me,"" Trump told union representatives as they joined Harley-Davidson executives in a recent meeting at the White House. ""Sometimes your top people didn't support me but the steelworkers supported me.""
Many left-leaning organizations are still trying to feel their ways around the new White House.
""It's like 'Game of Thrones' right now in the Trump administration -- it's kind of hard to tell who's going to come out on top,"" said Thea Lee, the AFL-CIO's deputy chief of staff.
US Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who represents many of those ""downriver"" voters, said she is focused on how to use language that makes clear that ""I am inclusive of everybody, but I'm also fighting for those UAW workers who think we've forgotten them, or those Teamsters whose pensions are being threatened to be cut.""
Dingell added: ""Those are our constituents who we have to be a voice for, too. We've got to find a way to talk about it so they know we are the fighters for them and that we will stand strong, and that we care about those issues.""
The populist solution
Increasingly, Democrats are moving toward a message styled after populist stalwarts such as Warren, Bernie Sanders and US Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio.
Their case: The problem wasn't Trump's promises, or what his campaign represented -- it's that in office, he's promoting his billionaire friends and failing to take care of those who carried him to the presidency.
US Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, another Democrat up for re-election in 2018, said 9,000 people turned out in January at a pro-Obamacare rally in Macomb County -- a key swing region that helped tip Michigan for Trump.
""There were people that I know that attended that supported President Trump that didn't really believe he was going to take away their health care or cut their Medicare,"" she said. ""People thought they were voting for change, and now are saying, 'Wait a minute, I didn't mean that.'
""I'm still fighting for the same people in Michigan that want a shot to stay in the middle class,"" Stabenow said. ""I think this is really more about (communicating) that.""
Other Democrats made a similar argument -- saying the activist energy is increasingly pushing them toward populist policies.
US Rep. Cheri Bustos, an Illinois Democrat who easily won in a district Trump carried, said the party's problems can be addressed partially through simple moves such as ""supermarket Saturdays,"" job-shadowing blue-collar workers and sitting through lengthy appearances on rural radio stations.
""We've also got to make sure that we're disciplined about what our values are. We know that our policies resonate with people -- with these folks who want to try Trump,"" she said.
""Our theory right now is that they're going to have buyer's remorse -- that they tried him because they wanted something different; they were tired of the status quo; they felt left behind by this wage stagnation,"" Bustos said. ""We have the right policies to address that. But we haven't always gone deep into the kind of districts where people have felt left behind.""
The Supreme Court problem
A particular cause of heartburn for red-state Democratic senators is the upcoming confirmation battle over Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.
It was, after all, the expectation that Trump would appoint conservative justices -- whose tenures would long outlast his presidency -- that kept many moderate Republicans behind his candidacy.
It's a conundrum: Do Democrats risk undercutting their own cause by waging war over Trump's most conventional decision yet?
So Senate Democrats are slow-walking their way around Gorsuch, promising to give him due consideration -- buying themselves more time to figure out whether they have 41 out of 48 Democratic votes necessary to block him, and whether it's even the fight they want.
""Explaining anything having to do with courts or law is a challenge -- not because it's inconsequential but because it can't be dramatized with a picture and a face and a voice,"" said US Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut.
""So we need to make sure the American people understand what's at stake,"" Blumenthal said. ""The gobbledygook and the legal jargon are very confusing. And just now as I'm talking to you, I'm realizing that I'm sort of going off into the ether.""
Moulitsas said red-state Democrats should forget using those votes to try to prove themselves as moderates.
The likes of Donnelly and Heitkamp ""aren't going to win re-election on the strength of Trump voters impressed by their confirmation votes,"" he said.
""The best chance they have to win in their tough states will be by riding this incredible wave of energy. It may not be enough, but pissing off the base certainly isn't the better bet. You either ride in with the people who brought you, or go down fighting honorably,"" Moulitsas said. ""Pretending to be a 'Republican, but a little less bad' has never inspired a dramatic re-election victory.""",negative
672,"Story highlights State Department official confirms reversal of canceled visas
State Department official confirms reversal of canceled visas Customs tells major US airlines it was ""back to business as usual,"" airline exec says
(CNN) Many international airlines are allowing nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries hit with President Donald Trump's travel ban to board US-bound flights after a federal judge blocked the controversial ban nationwide.
US Customs and Border Protection informed major American airlines on a conference call late Friday that it was ""back to business as usual,"" effective immediately, an airline executive told CNN.
The State Department has reversed the cancellation of visas provisionally revoked after Trump's executive order -- so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled.
The State Department has said fewer than 60,000 visas were revoked since Trump signed the order January 27. It was not immediately clear how many from that group will continue to be without their visas because their visas were physically canceled.
Also, the Department of Homeland Security has suspended all actions to implement the order.

673,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump first learned about a planned military raid in Yemen days before the mission actually took place, government officials told CNN, giving his conditional go-ahead to his top military brass over dinner in the White House residence.
The mission, which military officials said went off-track from the start, left Chief Petty Officer William ""Ryan"" Owens dead and three others injured. After putting out a statement that branded the assault of a heavily fortified Yemini compound a success, the Trump White House was left to defend the first military action ordered by the newly inaugurated commander in chief.
How Sunday's deadly joint US-United Arab Emirates counter-terrorism raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen was handed from the Obama to Trump administrations sheds light on the complications that occurred during the sometimes rocky transition of power and has led to a blame game between both camps.
Trump White House aides have defended the mission by saying that it was first considered and approved during Obama's time in office. But former senior government officials under Obama said the former President never signed off on the raid before leaving office.
While the military discussed various options for actions in Yemen, the 44th president felt such action ""represented a significant escalation of US involvement in Yemen,"" as one senior government official under Obama said.
Trump first learned of the plan the morning of Wednesday, January 25, days after he had been inaugurated, a White House official told CNN. James Mattis, Trump's secretary of defense, had already approved the raid by the time Trump learned of it, the official added.
Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, presented the President with a written memo about the planned raid in the morning and the two discussed it a number of times during the day, the official said. Trump then asked Flynn to arrange a meeting so he could solicit advice from Mattis and Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Flynn, Dunford and Mattis laid out the scenario for Trump over dinner, explaining to the President -- who has no military experience -- that there are inherent risks with a mission like this.
""The paper presented and the verbal information presented made it very clear that this was not a risk-free operation, there were risks, there were dangers,"" said one White House official.
Trump's trio of top White House advisers -- chief of staff Reince Priebus, senior adviser Jared Kushner and counselor to the president Stephen Bannon -- were at the dinner, the White House official said, along with Vice President Mike Pence, CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Keith Kellogg, chief of staff at the National Security Council.
The 10 men sat in the residence, discussing the specifics of the raid and what could go wrong. A source close to Flynn said that Trump was ""extremely active"" and ""asked a ton of questions"" during the meeting.
Trump personally invited Priebus, Kushner and Bannon to the dinner. ""They are entitled to be wherever the President wants them to be,"" the White House official said when asked about why politically minded aides were discussing the mission.
As the dinner wrapped up, Trump approved the raid, conditional on another round of meetings with deputies from the agencies. One official said Trump trusted Mattis' view of the situation, in part, because he reviewed the plan and approved it shortly after taking over at the Pentagon on January 20 -- the first day of Trump's presidency.
Discussed under Obama administration
During the Obama presidency, United States Central Command, under Gen. Joseph Votel, recommended the mission, in part, because US officials felt there was a need for a better intelligence picture of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, long considered to be the terror group's most capable franchise, a defense official told CNN.
This need was increased when troops from the UAE drove the organization from the port city of Mukalla, scattering its fighters into the more remote areas where they intermingled with local tribes. Sunday's raid was geared to better understand the nexus between regional tribal fighters and al Qaeda operatives.
That is why, the defense official said, the mission required boots on the ground, with US Navy SEALs taking the lead and UAE Special Forces providing support.
""A drone strike or bomb alone, while it may eliminate the threat, does not allow you to learn from that threat,"" US Navy Capt. Jeff Davis told reporters Thursday.
The operation was ""carefully planned and very deliberately planned,"" Davis said.
Approved by Pentagon
The plan was first delivered to the Pentagon on November 7 when US Central Command asked Defense Department lawyers for review and approval. Legal experts sent it to the National Security Council on December 19, Spicer said at Thursday's White House briefing.
The legal review used the existing post-9/11 Authorization for Use of Military Force to provide the justification for the raid, the US military official said, and Spicer cast the raid as an Obama administration-approved mission.
""Clearly, that was under the last administration,"" Spicer said. ""On December 19, the plan was approved by the Department of Defense and recommended that it be moved ahead.""
But approval by the Pentagon and approval by the President are two different things.
A former Obama administration Defense official said that plan was ""teed up"" by the Pentagon and approved by military brass.
Those closer to the White House, though, did not see it that way.
""It wasn't something the President approved and said good to go,"" said a former Obama administration official. The plan was discussed at several levels, but never fully approved -- because such situations are remarkably fluid based on daily intelligence and conditions on the ground.
Ned Price, former Special Assistant to Obama and the National Security Council responded to Spicer's briefing by arguing his timeline of events was wrong.
""The specific operation in question was never presented to or considered by the Obama Admin for approval,"" he tweeted.
A separate senior government official involved in the Obama administration's NSC told CNN that the Defense Department worked up general proposals for an overall set of targets in Yemen that were then discussed among the agencies in the closing weeks of Obama's term.
""This particular raid was not discussed -- just the broad framework,"" said the former government official. ""Moreover, no recommendation was made other than a recommendation to provide the next administration with the necessary information to make a decision after they had a chance to run their own deliberative interagency process.""
Decision left to Trump
But a current White House official claimed the order did go through National Security Council reviews until January 6, when a National Security Council Deputies Committee meeting was called. Deputies from Defense, State, CIA and the National Security Council met and approved the raid, contingent on the need for a moonless night.
One issue: The next moonless night would not come until Trump -- not Obama -- was president, meaning the new commander in chief would have to consider the raid before going forward.
After Mattis was sworn in to lead the Pentagon on January 20 -- the same day Trump took the oath of office -- the order was presented to the new secretary of defense for the first time, the White House official said. Mattis reviewed the plan for four days and sent it back to the National Security Council -- with two pages of notes -- on January 24.
After the dinner meeting, which many saw as the official go ahead for the plan, the group of deputies -- which now under the Trump administration included KT McFarland, Trump's deputy national security adviser - met again January 26 and approved the order.
Trump officially signed off on the plan January 26, kicking it into high gear given the next moonless night was a mere four days away, the White House official said.
The raid
There was no intelligence indicating the presence of civilians when the raid started, according to military officials. Drones flew over the site during the entirety of the raid, giving military planners updates on the mission.
The operation was considered relatively risky by military officials and in order to mitigate the risk, US Marines aboard the USS Makin Island in the Gulf of Aden were standing by to assist. Multiple MV-22 Osprey aircraft, officials said, were sent to rendezvous with the Navy SEALs when they came under intense fire. Harrier jets and Cobra helicopters were also standing by to assist.
One of the Ospreys experienced a hard landing during the operation, making it inoperable, a defense official said. The Osprey was intentionally destroyed in place so that it couldn't be used by enemy combatants.
In addition to US military casualties, the London-based NGO Reprieve and a Sanaa-based human rights worker told CNN that at least 23 civilians were killed in the attack.
""The villagers feel very terrified by what happened,"" Mohammed al-Qawli, head of Yemen's National Organization for Drone Victims, told CNN, ""They can't believe what happened. They feel the world has let them down. Sadness hangs over the whole area.""
Mattis was attending the Alfalfa Dinner, an elite social gathering in Washington, at the time of the raid and was informed there that the US had suffered casualties during the operation.
Mattis left the event early to help address the situation.
""We believed it was worth the risk,"" said a US military official, who noted the operational commander on the ground in Yemen could have scrapped the mission at anytime. ""It's a military assault. There's going to be risk.""",negative

Eman Ali was born in Yemen in 2005, when her pregnant mother went there to help with a family emergency. Eman is the only member of her family who's not an American citizen.
When they were ready to return home to California in 2007, they couldn't because of Eman's immigration status. The family found out Eman wasn't a citizen because her mother hadn't lived in the United States for five years before she was born.
The paperwork for Eman's visa took years, so her mother and sister stayed with her in Yemen while her father worked at a shopping center to support them.
In 2013 they made an agonizing choice.
""I (had) to let my wife and oldest daughter (come) to (the) US and leave my little one with my dad and mom. I had no choice,"" Ali said. ""I couldn't leave my whole family in Yemen.""
They thought Eman would join them soon, but it was almost four years before Ali got to make the trip to Djibouti to finalize her visa at the US Embassy there. The United States does not have an embassy in Yemen because of the civil war that has devastated the country.
""We thought that's it, it's the end. The family will be together. Eman was really happy after all those years,"" Ali said. ""And then they come with a new law.""
It's too dangerous to send Eman back to Yemen, so they are staying in a Djibouti hotel. It's expensive, and he can't work.
The Alis have joined a class action lawsuit against the immigration policy and have gotten support from US Rep. Jim Costa of California.
Maryam Hani, 6, Iraq
Maryam Hani, age 6, is being treated for leukemia in Egypt
Maryam Hani was diagnosed with leukemia in October by doctors in an Egyptian refugee camp. Her family fled Iraq's Anbar province in December 2014 to escape ISIS.
""After ISIS came to Anbar, they attacked the area and arrested people and killed people,"" Maryam's mother, Lequaa Jasim, told CNN through a translator. ""We decided to find a safe place for the family.""
Maryam's father sold his carpentry business and used the money for pay for their dangerous journey to Egypt.
Since they are refugees, they have to pay for Maryam's treatment out of their own pockets.
Refugees also aren't allowed to work, so they are getting by with help from Maryam's grandparents, who are permanent US residents and have lived in Boise, Idaho, since 2014.
Holda Sadeq, Maryam's grandmother, says she would like to go to Egypt to help file for a medical visa that would let Maryam come to the United States. However, she has an Iraqi passport, so she fears she would not be able to return to the country.
""Holda is just learning English. She's concerned that if she gets on a plane and gets detained somewhere, how is she going to communicate,"" said Drew Lobner, a social worker who's been working with the family since they came to America.
For now, they're waiting and continuing with Maryam's medical treatment.
""She's tired and is still in the hospital and she had chemotherapy last week, and today they will give her some vitamins,"" Sadeq told CNN on Friday.
Maryam has another big chemotherapy treatment coming up and doctors say they will do everything they can to make sure she's well enough to travel if she gets permission to leave, the family said.
Dilbireen Muhsin, 2, Iraq
2-year-old Dilibreen
Severe burns disfigured little Dilbireen Muhsin's face.
The toddler's family was forced to flee their home to escape the bloodshed brought on by ISIS when they attacked their village in 2014. They're Yazidis, part of a small community living around Mount Sinjar in Iraq.
Dilbireen's family found shelter among other displaced Yazidis in a refugee camp, where Dilbireen was born on January 4, 2015. A year later, around Dilbireen's first birthday, a fire sparked by a malfunctioning gas heater set his crib ablaze. His mother was baking bread outside when her baby's crib went up in flames, and people nearby rushed to his aid.
Dilbireen was severely burned on his face and feet, but a blanket protected the rest of his body from harm.
Dilbireen arrived in the United States last year to receive medical treatment for his severe burns.
While he now lives with a family in Lansing, Michigan, his parents and baby brother are in their native country, Iraq. They're making efforts to be by Dilbireen's side in the United States, but their travel visas were revoked in early January.
President Donald Trump's travel ban now has them concerned that they won't be able to get back to Dilbireen and that he might return to Iraq without additional surgeries to improve the function of his face.
Fatemeh Reshad, 4 months, Iran
A 4-month-old Iranian girl trying to come to the US for life saving heart surgery is denied a visa due to President Trump's travel ban
The travel ban has delayed an Iranian family's plan to bring their daughter to the United States for potentially lifesaving surgery.
Fatemeh and her family received an all-clear to enter the US for critical surgery, N.Y. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday.
The family was going to fly to Portland, Oregon, where they have relatives, so Fatemeh could get the treatment she needs. They flew to Dubai, but when they arrived, they were rerouted back to Iran and told to reapply for a US visa in 90 days.
Many state and federal officials have intervened on behalf of the family, a Washington, D.C.-based immigration attorney working on the case, Amber Murray told CNN.
Attorneys involved with the case worked with State Department officials to help the family obtain an emergency waiver to navigate around the ban.
Mushkaad Abdi, 4, Somalia
Mushkaad Abdi
Samira Dahir hadn't seen her 4-year-old daughter, Mushkaad, since she was a few months old.
Dahir had just gotten a visa for herself and her two other daughers when Mushkaad was born. She would have had to start the immigration process over if she remained in Somalia, so she decided instead to leave Mushkaad with a family friend and bring her two other daughters to the United States.
Mushkaad had just gotten her visa and was scheduled to fly to Minnesota on Tuesday, but she wasn't allowed on the flight because of the travel ban.
US Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and new Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, made direct pleas to have Mushkaad resettled as a refugee.
She was reunited with her mother and two older sisters Thursday.
""It's been heart-wrenching for Samira and her two older daughters, who have waited to be reunited with Mushkaad since she was an infant,"" Franken said in a statement. ""I'm very pleased that after far too long of a separation this Minnesota family is now together.""
At a news conference Friday in Minneapolis, Dahir thanked everyone who helped her reunite with her daughter.
""I'm very happy today that my daughter Mushkaad is home,"" a tearful Dahir said. ""A lot of people had to work to get my daughter.""
Earlier this week, Dahir told CNN affiliate WCCO that she and her older daughters, ages 7 and 8, had decorated a room for their sister and had presents waiting for her.
Now Mushkaad will be able to enjoy it.",positive
676,"Story highlights Trump will issue a broad directive meant to garner input from the heads of federal regulatory agencies on areas for reform
A second action will direct the Department of Labor to cease implementation of an Obama administration rule on retirement investment advisers
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump will begin work Friday dismantling the financial regulations enacted after the 2008 economic crisis, hours after the first major economic report of his administration is released.
Trump's executive moves won't have an immediate effect on Wall Street oversight. But they're likely to draw sharp criticism from Democrats and reform proponents who say the regulations that the President is looking to scrap could prevent another meltdown.
In two executive actions, Trump plans to direct his administration to evaluate regulatory action taken by his predecessor, Barack Obama, with an eye toward eliminating what his advisers say are burdensome rules on financial services firms and consumers.
He'll also force the delay of an Obama-era rule that required retirement advisers to act in their clients' best interests.
The midday moves will come after the Labor Department releases jobs figures from January. Hiring rebounded sharply under Obama following the financial crisis, but Trump has previously questioned the accuracy of the monthly reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

678,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's government moved swiftly Saturday to comply with a federal judge's order halting his travel ban -- even as Trump himself denounced the judge -- but readied its legal defense of the controversial executive action.
The Department of Homeland Security announced it has suspended all actions to implement the immigration order and will resume standard inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the travel ban. But it said the Justice Department -- which is expected to file an emergency motion to stop the order -- needed to challenge the ruling ""at the earliest possible time.""
""(Trump's order) is intended to protect the homeland and the American people, and the President has no higher duty and responsibility than to do so,"" acting DHS press secretary Gillian Christensen said when announcing the suspension.
But already, the nation was in the midst of a second straight weekend of widespread uncertainty over the controversial ban, this time with the administration on defense.
A State Department official told CNN the department has reversed the cancellation of visas that were provisionally revoked following the President's executive order last week -- so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled.
The department transmitted a cable to all posts Saturday instructing them to resume the visa process as they had before the executive order, two senior State Department officials said.
The officials told CNN those whose visas were physically canceled would have to go to an embassy or consulate to have them reinstated. Most cancellations were done electronically and reinstated electronically, they said.
The State Department has said fewer than 60,000 visas were revoked since the signing of the order. It was not immediately clear how many from that group will continue to be without their visas because their visas were physically canceled.
Following the judge's ruling -- and before the government's announcements Saturday morning -- the International Air Transportation Association, a worldwide airline industry trade group, cited US Customs and Border Protection in telling its members to follow procedures ""as if the executive order never existed.""
Trump's order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
'Outrageous' order
Federal Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee who presides in Seattle, halted the enforcement of Trump's order Friday night, effective nationwide.
Robart, ruling in a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota who sought to stop the order, said the states ""have met their burden of demonstrating that they face immediate and irreparable injury as a result of the signing and implementation of the Executive Order. ""
He said the order adversely affects residents in areas of education, employment, education and freedom to travel.
Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson told CNN's Anderson Cooper Friday night that he was prepared to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.
""As a lawyer, it's why you go to law school."" Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson https://t.co/qcJmFtQl1x https://t.co/30y1sSM9tk — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) February 4, 2017
Robart's decision was met with swift denunciation by the White House -- which originally called it ""outrageous"" before removing that word in a statement issued minutes later -- and Trump himself, who blasted the judge personally Saturday morning.
""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"" he tweeted
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017
Trump also sent out a series of tweets lamenting the ruling.
""When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot, come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!"" he tweeted.
When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017
Robart's ruling may have stung even more for the Trump administration because it came on the heels of its first legal victory over the travel ban. Hours earlier Friday, a federal judge in Boston issued a more limited ruling that declined to renew a temporary restraining order in Massachusetts, which would have prohibited the detention or removal of foreign travelers legally authorized to come to the Boston area.
But it was the sweeping ruling from Seattle that had the federal government scrambling.
Visas to be reinstated
CBP alerted airlines Friday night that the US government would quickly begin reinstating visas that were previously canceled, and it advised airlines that refugees in possession of US visas will be admitted as well, an airline executive said.
CBP told major US airlines Friday night that the government is in the process of reinstating visas and is ""back to business as usual"" before the situation that was in place before last week's executive order, the airline executive told CNN. Airlines were expected to remove travel alerts from their websites and get messages out to customers to alert them about the change.
It is possible there will be more court activity and an appeal before anyone could act on getting a visa, and it's unclear how long it would take to obtain one.
US airlines use an automated system connected to the Customs and Border Protection database to scan passports and visas to get an instant determination if the passenger can board or not. Unless the government reinstates visas and the airlines get a ""board"" status, the airlines still would not allow such passengers to board.
Airlines were adjusting to the new developments Saturday. Qatar Airways announced it will allow nationals from the seven countries affected by Trump's travel ban and all refugees presenting a valid, unexpired US visa or green card to travel to the United States.
Refugee groups relieved
Refugee resettlement agencies across the US welcomed Robart's ruling.
""President Trump's ban against refugees and Muslims was not only un-American, but Judge Robart found it to be unconstitutional,"" Mark Hetfield, president and CEO of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, told CNN on Saturday. ""Thanks to Judge Robart's order protecting the Constitution, thousands of refugees who were bound for the US can finally find protection -- and a warm welcome -- here.""
""But this won't be the end of our fight to keep America's door open to refugees,"" he added.
Because of the logistical coordination required to organize refugee arrivals, resettlement groups reached by CNN did not expect them to resume immediately.
Once a refugee is vetted and approved for resettlement, the agencies coordinate with the International Organizations for Migration to arrange their placement with a local chapter. The UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees is involved in that process, as are the Departments of State and Homeland Security, and the government of the country from which refugees are applying.
Resettlement agencies have been working with the State Department's Bureau of Population Refugees and Migration to determine when admissions can resume while local branches prepare to welcome the new arrivals.
Daniel Smith, an immigration attorney in Seattle, predicted a ""flood of people trying to enter the US over the next few days"" due to the legal opening.
""I am advising clients who are in the country now -- don't leave,"" Smith said. ""And any clients wanting to enter the country, it's best if you try to get in right now and then stay put if you get here.""
Likely to affect Gorsuch confirmation process
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump's criticism of the judge will be cited in the Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch.
""The President's attack on Judge James Robart, a Bush appointee who passed with 99 votes, shows a disdain for an independent judiciary that doesn't always bend to his wishes and a continued lack of respect for the Constitution, making it more important that the Supreme Court serve as an independent check on the administration,"" Schumer said in a statement.
""With each action testing the Constitution, and each personal attack on a judge, President Trump raises the bar even higher for Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Supreme Court. His ability to be an independent check will be front and center throughout the confirmation process.""
And Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement, ""We need a nominee for the Supreme Court willing to demonstrate he or she will not cower to an overreaching executive.
""This makes it even more important that Judge Gorsuch, and every other judge this President may nominate, demonstrates the ability to be an independent check and balance on an administration that shamefully and harmfully seems to reject the very concept.""

679,"Story highlights The temporary restraining order affected travelers arriving in Massachusetts
The Department of Homeland Security is looking to clear up some confusion about the travel order
Washington (CNN) In the first court victory for the Trump administration, a federal judge in Boston declined Friday to renew a temporary restraining order affecting Massachusetts that prohibited the detention or removal of foreign travelers legally authorized to come to the US.
The win in court comes at the same time that the administration issued a clarification to its travel order allowing for some citizens from the seven banned countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- to enter the US under specific circumstances. It was issued shortly before a federal judge in Washington state issued a temporary restraining order against the travel ban effective nationwide.
The original temporary restraining order in Massachusetts, issued by US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs and US Magistrate Judge Judith Dein, was put in place early Sunday morning and was set to expire on February 5.
But a different federal judge, US District Court Judge Nathaniel Gordon, ruled Friday that the claims brought by legal permanent residents are now moot given the White House counsel's recent clarification that the travel ban order does not apply such individuals.
Gordon went on to additionally conclude that because the other plaintiffs in the case -- Iranian nationals and Oxfam America, Inc. -- did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim, ""an extension of the restraining order at the present time is not warranted.""

681,"Story highlights A majority, 53%, say they oppose the order
The public is more closely divided on whether the order makes the US safer or protects American values
Washington (CNN) Most Americans oppose the travel restrictions put in place by President Donald Trump's executive order last week, a new CNN/ORC poll has found.
Fifty-five percent say they see it as an attempt to ban Muslims from entering the US. Further, 6 in 10 oppose Trump's plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico.
Overall, 47% say they favor the executive order on travel, which prohibits entry to the US for 90 days by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries while suspending the US refugee program for 120 days and reducing the total number of refugees the US will accept this year. A majority, 53%, say they oppose the order. Those who favor the ban say by a 2-to-1 margin that they would like to see it expanded to other countries.
Opposition to the travel ban rests somewhat on perceptions that it fulfills one of Trump's campaign proposals: A ban on entry for Muslims. The perception that the executive order is an attempt to ban Muslims from entering is driven largely by opponents of the order -- 82% of whom see it as a Muslim ban, though a quarter of those who support it also see it as an attempt to ban Muslims from entering the country (25% say so).

683,"Over the course of a week, he had a bruising telephone call with the leader of Australia , one of America's closet allies. He complained to the Mexican President about that country's ""handling"" of ""tough hombres.""
Trump on Friday warned in a tweet that Iran was ""playing with fire"" with its ballistic missile tests, part of an emerging strategy designed to show his administration will take a much harder line with the Islamic Republic.
But his administration stuck to the tools of traditional diplomacy by using a statement from Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer to warn Israel that new Israeli settlement activity could potentially hamper the peace process, a new stance for a White House that's remained adamant in its support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Throughout his campaign, Trump hailed the virtues of being unpredictable on the world stage. Much to the happiness of some of his supporters, he's following through. But in the process, Trump is confusing much of the world. He's also handing some leaders, such as those in the United Kingdom and Mexico, political headaches of their own after encountering Trump. And some of America's allies are beginning to warn that Trump is putting over 70 years of transatlantic cooperation at risk.
""His style of diplomacy is very different from his recent predecessors,"" former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told CNN International's Hala Gorani Thursday. ""He is much more in your face. I suppose the diplomacy of the rest of us is kind of going to have to get used to that.""
Michael Fullilove, the executive director of the Lowy Institute, a top Australian think-tank, said that while the US-Australia alliance would remain strong in the aftermath of the tense phone call, Trump's approach would inevitably have an impact.
""It's a level of discourtesy that we don't expect,"" he said. ""It will continue to inform the Australian public's view of Mr. Trump. I think inevitably it would inform public opinion about the alliance.""
Transactional diplomacy
Trump seems to view diplomacy through the prism of a business transaction, where there are winners and losers and a belief that even allies can take advantage of the US.
His foreign policy thinking -- at least so far -- appears to be focusing more on the mechanics of individual national relationships and less on a strategic vision in which allies are a vehicle for expressing US power and influence around the globe.
The President's phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull went off the rails when discussion turned to a deal concluded by former President Barack Obama to allow 1,250 refugees from an offshore detention center to come to the United States.
Trump tweeted Thursday that the deal was ""dumb,"" even though Spicer has said the US would honor the agreement and despite the President's order to temporarily halt all refugees from entering the country.
The President was still fulminating about the deal by Thursday afternoon.
""I just said why?... Why are we doing this? What's the purpose?"" Trump told reporters. ""We have wonderful allies and we're going to keep it that way but we need to be treated fairly also.""
Trump's decision to question the deal has rattled relations with Australia, a crucial pillar of US Asia-Pacific strategy, a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing agreement and an ally that has battled alongside the United States dating back to World War I.
Sen. John McCain, who fought with Australians in Vietnam, took it upon himself to smooth over relations on Thursday following Trump's showdown with Turnbull, telephoning Australia's ambassador to Washington.
""This in my view was unnecessary and frankly, harmful,"" the Arizona Republican said, adding that the dispute was far less important than cooperation, including joint training missions involving US Marines in the northern Australian city of Darwin.
Senior Democrats were also disturbed by the argument.
Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said to have a ""contentious conversation and name call (a) country or the Prime Minister of a country that is one of our greatest allies in Asia is foolish.""
""He is doing kind of amateur hour stuff on matters of significant national importance,"" said Kaine, who was the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee.
Lesson for foreign leaders
Foreign policy experts said the US-Australia relationship remains too strong to be damaged. But the spat will be seen by other foreign leaders as a lesson in the difficulty of dealing with Trump.
British Prime Minister Theresa May found out that leaders who align themselves with Trump can get burned. The President didn't tell her he was signing an executive order restricting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries soon after she left the White House last Friday, exposing her to a torrent of political criticism back home.
Trump's frequent criticisms of the European Union, which he has branded corrupt while apparently rooting for more nations to join Britain by voting to leave, is irking US allies, who see the block, for all its faults, as the root of decades of peace in Europe, a continent previously wracked by centuries of war.
""It is unacceptable that there should be, through a number of statements by the US President, pressure on what Europe should be or what it should no longer be,"" French President Francois Hollande said at the EU summit in Malta on Friday,
""There is no future with Trump if it's not worked together,"" Hollande said, according to an official Twitter account for France's representative to the EU.
Trump has also criticized the other bulwark of European security, NATO, as obsolete and has far more in common with populist leaders seeking to make an impact in elections this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany than the ruling elites in those nations.
Despite anodyne government readouts, there were also hints of tension in Trump's weekend call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom the President has criticized for welcoming Syrian refugees.
Her office said Merkel ""explained"" to Trump that the Geneva Conventions require nations to offer a haven from refugees fleeing war.
But Trump is unapologetic about the bracing conversations he is having with world leaders -- a sign the White House is more concerned about Trump projecting a strong image on the world stage than stepping on diplomatic toes.
""The world is in trouble, but we're going to straighten it out. OK? That's what I do. I fix things. We're going to straighten it out,"" Trump said at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday. ""Believe me. When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it. Just don't worry about it. They're tough. We have to tough ... We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually. It's not going to happen anymore.""
Trump's pugnacious approach to diplomacy is not surprising given his personality, which he used to great effect in his business career. While his attitude dismays foreign policy elites, it's likely to be welcomed by voters who turned to him in search of strong leadership and see his encounters as a manifestation of his ""America First"" philosophy.
But several diplomats have said Trump's acute course corrections in foreign policy and blunt manner make it difficult to decipher exactly where the United States now stands on key global issues.
Private vs. public arguments
Getting tough with America's friends also represents a break from previous administrations where disagreements often erupted but were not litigated in public. The White House may find in future that creating political problems for friendly leaders will make it more difficult for them to compromise with Washington or even to send troops to help fight America's wars.
""We have an unwritten rule in diplomacy, you are going to argue with your friends but do it behind closed doors, don't expose differences, in public,"" Nicholas Burns, a longtime US diplomat and former under secretary of state for political affairs, told CNN International. ""Don't make life difficult for your friends, the Prime Minister of Australia, the Chancellor of Germany, the President of Mexico.""",negative
684,"Washington (CNN) Tens of thousands of migrants traveling through Mexico and seeking asylum in the United States could be sent back to Mexico, thanks to a little-noticed provision in President Donald Trump's recent border security executive order.
The language tucked into Trump's order on building a border wall instructs the Department of Homeland Security to use an obscure federal law to send land-arriving migrants back to neighboring territory, even as they continue to await court proceedings in the United States.
The policy shift would mean that even if they are thought to have a credible claim to asylum, they may be forced to wait years in Mexico for a future court date in the US.
The way the law is structured, most of the affected individuals would likely be Central American migrants fleeing violence and drug cartels in their home countries by making the trek north through Mexico.
As non-Mexican citizens, Mexico would not be obligated to take these individuals in -- and the move comes at a time when relations between the two countries are already at a historically tense point.
Critics of Trump's approach to immigration say the policy is a solution in search of a problem and in fact causes more issues than it fixes both in terms of relations with Mexico and the impact on the individual lives involved.
Supporters of the move, who largely hail from the conservative school of thought on immigration policy, say it serves two purposes. First, it could press Mexico to do more to stop the flow of Central American and other migrants north through its territory as they seek a way into the US.
Second, they argue, it would begin to stop what they see as a persistent issue of immigrants seeking a life in the US presenting themselves at the border, claiming a right to asylum and then disappearing as they await final judgment on their case.
The provision in question is Section 7 of Trump's border security order last week. ""The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.""
A US government source familiar with the draft implementation documents for the order confirms that the intent is to use US law to send asylum seekers to Mexico, or potentially Canada if that's where they arrive from, to await their formal hearing.
A Trump administration official would not say how often the White House intends to use the maneuver. ""'Appropriate action' does nothing more than preserve our options with respect to many different policies and procedures,"" the official said.
But the policy could impact tens of thousands of people per year, according to government statistics.
The Trump administration has already kicked off under tense relations with Mexico -- from threatening tariffs on products manufactured there, to insisting the government will reimburse the US for a wall along its border.
Adding on an attempt to force Mexico to accept tens of thousands of non-Mexican families to wait for years on a decision in the US could further damage the already tense relationship -- at a time when the US still needs Mexico's cooperation on a host of issues including border security and drug trafficking.
""I can't see the Mexicans accepting that,"" said Jeffery Davidow, a senior counselor at the Cohen Group and former career foreign service officer and ambassador to Mexico from 1998 to 2002. ""Asylum seekers should be the concern and responsibility of the country in which they're seeking asylum, and if they make it to the United States, I don't see the Mexican government taking on that responsibility.""
How it works
When migrants present themselves at the border with the US without valid entry documents, they are usually placed in expedited removal proceedings. But if they say they are seeking asylum, they are given what's called a ""credible fear"" interview. If after a series of questions an immigration officer determines they may have a claim to asylum, they are given a court date, often years in the future.
In fiscal year 2016, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services numbers, 92,990 decisions were made nationwide on credible fear, and in 73,081 cases, fear was established -- almost 80% of the cases.
Immigration hawks argue that too many of these individuals never show up for court, instead living illegally in the US.
Rather than keeping these people in detention centers in the US for years, Section 7 would allow the US to send them back to the contiguous territory from which they entered.
""Mexico has not really been forced to deal with this stream of migration through their country as long as the US was accepting them, so this change in policy is going to force them to have to rethink their policy on these people,"" said Jessica Vaughan of the conservative immigration policy Center for Immigration Studies.
The US government official who works on border security, who spoke on condition of anonymity to not get ahead of the administration, said the policy change would likely go over well enough on Capitol Hill, even among more moderate Republicans.
""This helps put Mexico on the hook for holding and detaining these people until their asylum claims are adjudicated, and what that means is it's a great incentive for the Mexicans to actually cooperate with us to secure our Southern border, so Mexico has skin in the game,"" the official said. ""Right now Mexico can take these people and send them north and it's not Mexico's problem. This makes it Mexico's problem.""
The official cited Customs and Border Patrol numbers of more than 16,000 family units and more than 7,000 unaccompanied children apprehended at the southwest border in December alone, part of a steady uptick in the last quarter of 2016.
'Flashpoint of provocation'
It's not clear, however, why Mexico would agree to the change in policy. Mexicans can already be sent back to Mexico, but the majority of asylum seekers at the border come from elsewhere, often fleeing violence and cartels in Central America. If Mexico were to decline to accept migrants, the situation could escalate if the US were to try to force them to.
The Mexican embassy in Washington and President's office in Mexico City did not respond to a request for comment on the policy shift.
Karen Musalo, a professor at University of California Hastings law school specializing in refugee studies, says that Mexico has already been doing ""dirty work for the US"" in terms of intercepting migrants making their way north and working to shut down drug smugglers.
""This could be another flashpoint of provocation,"" Musalo said. ""Treating these people like lawbreakers, it's not the appropriate narrative, because people fleeing persecution, they're entitled to seek protection. And if they don't qualify for protection, then they're likely to be returned, but let's not start from the assumption that these people are criminals.""",negative
685,"A majority, 53%, disapprove of the way the President is handling his job, according to a new CNN/ORC poll , marking the highest disapproval for a new elected president since polls began tracking those results. Trump is the only President to hold a net-negative rating this early in his tenure.
Overall, 44% approve of the way he's handling the job, seven points below the previous low-point of 51%. Further, the share who disapprove ""strongly"" of Trump's work as president is nearly as large as the total block who approve, 43% feel intensely negative about Trump. Partisanship is the sharpest divider in opinions on Trump (90% of Republicans approve vs. 10% of Democrats).
Trump's high disapproval most clearly differentiates his ratings from those of his predecessors. While Ronald Reagan's first approval rating measure of 51% from Gallup in 1981 was not that far above Trump's 44% now, Reagan's disapproval number was far lower than Trump's (13% to 53%). And George W. Bush, the last president to be elected without capturing the popular vote, held a far more positive 57% overall approval rating in February of his first year in office, with just 25% disapproving.
Several specific actions Trump has taken in his first two weeks are also meeting with majority opposition, according to the poll. Most oppose the travel restrictions put in place by executive order last week, and 55% say they see it as an attempt to ban Muslims from entering the US. Further, 6 in 10 oppose Trump's plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico.
Overall, 47% say they favor the executive order on travel, which prohibits entry to the US for 90 days by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries while suspending the US refugee program for 120 days and reducing the total number of refugees the US will accept this year. A majority, 53%, say they oppose the order. Those who favor the ban say by a 2-to-1 margin that they would like to see it expanded to other countries.
Opposition to the travel ban rests somewhat on perceptions that it fulfills one of Trump's campaign proposals: A ban on entry for Muslims. The perception that the executive order is an attempt to ban Muslims from entering is driven largely by opponents of the order -- 82% of whom see it as a Muslim ban, though a quarter of those who support it also see it as an attempt to ban Muslims from entering the country (25% say so).
The public is more closely divided on whether the order makes the US safer or protects American values, two arguments the Trump administration has put forth in support of the order. About 4 in 10 (41%) agree with the Trump administration's contention that the ban makes the US safer from terrorism, while more (46%) say it makes the US less safe from terrorism and another 12% say it doesn't make a difference. Further, just about half (49%) think the order harms American values by keeping out people who are seeking asylum, while 43% say it does more to protect American values by keeping out people who don't support those values.
Across all these questions, opinions are sharply divided by party. Democrats are just as apt to oppose the executive order (88%) as Republicans are to support it (88%); independents tilt against, with 54% opposed. Republicans are 10 times as likely as Democrats to say the order makes the US safer (83% of Republicans vs. 8% of Democrats), and their opinions are again 180 degrees apart when asked about its impact on American values (80% of Republicans say it protects them while 81% of Democrats say it harms them).
There is also a sharp partisan divide on whether America should accept Syrian refugees generally, with 73% of Democrats in favor compared with just 30% of Republicans. Support for accepting refugees has risen across partisan divides since late 2015, however, from 38% support in late 2015 to 54% now, including 13-point increases in support among both Democrats and Republicans.
Considering another executive order from the first days of the Trump presidency, Americans remain largely opposed to building a wall along the entire border with Mexico. In September, 41% favored that; 38% do so now. Opposition to the construction of a border wall now stands at 60%. Trump ordered immediate construction of the wall through an executive order signed less than a week after taking office, but the order does not address funding for the wall. Those in favor of building it support the Trump administration's proposal to fund it through import taxes on goods imported from Mexico by a wide margin.
Assessing Trump's work on a range of issues so far, majorities disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration (56%), foreign affairs (55%) and terrorism (53%). Half (50%) disapprove of his handling of health care policy as he seeks to roll back the provisions of Obamacare, while 42% approve of his work on health care. Americans are split, 49% approve to 46% disapprove, on his handling of national security. The economy remains Trump's bright spot, with 49% approving vs. 43% disapproving.
A broad majority, 78%, say the way Trump has handled the presidency so far is how they expected him to, with just 21% saying the way he's handling the job is unexpected. Still, those who have been surprised by his work don't see it as a pleasant one: 17% say it's been a bad thing vs. 3% who say he's performed unexpectedly well.

The daughter of Hillary Clinton has repeatedly been critical of President Donald Trump
(CNN) Chelsea Clinton, Hillary Clinton's daughter, took a shot at Kellyanne Conway on Twitter Friday, faulting the top Trump adviser for citing a non-existent ""massacre"" to defend the President's travel ban.
""Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks,"" Clinton tweeted.
During an interview Thursday on MSNBC, Conway faulted the media for not covering the fact that Obama ""had a six month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre.""
Obama didn't ban the Iraqi refugee program , though increased vetting related to Iraqi refugees was put in place, and there was no Bowling Green massacre. Conway later tweeted she was referring to a terror case involving two men convicted of a series of charges involving a plot to help al Qaeda. The men were allowed into the US as refugees.
Conway bluntly responded to Clinton on Twitter on Friday, slamming her mother's quality as a candidate and mentioning how Hillary Clinton, as first lady, once falsely claimed that she came under sniper fire in Bosnia.

None appears forthcoming from the White House
Washington (CNN) A full week has passed since President Donald Trump said he would sign an executive order opening a Justice Department investigation into his unsubstantiated claim that millions of people voted illegally in November.
The Oval Office signing was abruptly canceled last Thursday and never rescheduled. The White House hasn't talked about it since. The President has moved on to other subjects.
A senior administration official told CNN that the voter fraud investigation is no longer a top priority for the President, insisting it's not off the table, but not expected anytime soon.
The President has repeatedly claimed without evidence that 3 to 5 million people -- mainly undocumented immigrants -- committed voter fraud in his race with Hillary Clinton. He lost the popular vote to Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.
For days, the allegations overshadowed his message. Republican congressional leaders privately urged him to drop the matter, which escalated after Trump declared last week on Twitter: ""I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and ... even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time).""

The rogue resistance has not been confined to the halls of Washington power
(CNN) The pitched resistance to the Trump administration's early onslaught of executive actions and controversial Cabinet nominations has increasingly come to be defined and inspired by a coalition of the unassuming -- bureaucrats and mostly anonymous civil servants.
For the first time in more than a decade, Democrats in Washington are the minority party in both chambers of Congress with no White House to push back on or reject the Republican agenda. Nearly powerless as President Donald Trump seeks to impose his will on the machinery of government, opponents and conflicted nonpartisan civil servants have been forced to seek out new and unusual means of resistance.
The administration's actions are not entirely outside the realm of the recognizable -- new presidents have the prerogative to highlight their priorities and downgrade others. But Trump and his inner circle's delight in attacking political norms -- the strategic underpinning of his winning candidacy -- and their decision to author and implement a shock and awe series of orders in such rapid succession has inspired its own brand of asymmetrical blowback.

Trump won last year's Virginia Republican primary, but lost the state in the general election
(CNN) President Donald Trump won't have to face voters for several more years, but his policies will be on the ballot in just a few months.
Candidates for Virginia governor must pass through a rigorous primary in early June before entering the general election. Already, both Republicans and Democrats are using Trump's first few weeks in office to distinguish themselves against their primary opponents.
There are three candidates on the Republican side. Two -- Corey Stewart and Denver Riggleman -- are hoping to ride Trump's anti-establishment wave to their party's nomination and eventually the governor's mansion. The third candidate, former George W. Bush aide Ed Gillespie, embodies the GOP establishment and is seeking to consolidate the many factions of the state party to give Republicans their first statewide win since 2009.
The GOP candidates have vastly different backgrounds in the state. Stewart is the chair of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors and has previously run for statewide office. Riggleman is a businessman who is virtually unknown in Virginia. Gillespie is fresh off a narrow loss to popular Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in 2014 and is running a solid, risk-averse campaign.

699,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump veered off script at the start of the National Prayer Breakfast Thursday when he asked a room full of lawmakers, foreign dignitaries and religious leaders to pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger so that ratings of his show -- NBC's ""The Apprentice"" -- would go up.
Trump, who lauded the six-decade long traditional gathering as a ""testament to the power of faith"" was introduced by Mark Burnett, the television producer who teamed up with Trump to create ""The Apprentice."" The hit show arguably launched Trump's political ambitions.
Trump left the show, however, in 2015 as he explored a presidential run and Burnett replaced him with Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former California governor.
""We know how that turned out,"" Trump said, knocking Schwarzenegger. ""The ratings went right down the tubes. It has been a disaster.""
Trump then turned to the audience and said: ""I want to just pray for Arnold ... for those ratings.""
The comment may have been intended as a joke, but Trump's opening came in sharp contrast to how past presidents have addressed the breakfast.
Schwarzenegger promptly replied via a Twitter video: ""Hey Donald. I have a great idea. Why don't we switch jobs? You take over TV, cause you're such an expert in ratings. And I take over your job, so that people can finally sleep comfortably again.""
Trump and Schwarzenegger have been in a public back-and-forth since the former California governor took over the show.
Trump is still listed as an executive producer on the current season, and the assets he put in a trust managed by his sons still includes a financial stake in the reality show.
The annual multi-faith breakfast is held on the first Thursday of February each year. Lawmakers and religious leaders from about 70 countries gather at the Washington event, first organized in 1953. It is meant to bring bipartisan political leaders and their religious counterparts together to meet, pray and build relationships. Every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has headlined the event.
Trump used his remarks to weigh in on reports circulating on his phone calls with foreign leaders from Australia and Mexico, attempting to allay concerns.
""When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it. Just don't worry about it. They're tough. We have to be tough. It's time we're going to be a little tough, folks,"" he said. ""We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually. It's not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen anymore.""
The keynote speaker at the National Prayer Breakfast was Barry Black, the chaplain of the United States Senate.
Moved by Black's remarks, Trump lauded him.
""Thank you as well to senator chaplain Barry Black for his moving words,"" he said.
Trump added: ""I don't know, chaplain, whether that's an appointed position? Is that an appointed position? I don't know if you're Democrat or Republican, but I'm appointing you for another year. The hell with it.""
To many, especially the religious leaders in the room, ""hell"" is a swear word.
When then-President Barack Obama spoke at the national prayer event in 2016, he highlighted the importance of needing to overcome fear through faith.
Trump also touched on supporting religious liberty, protecting national security and defending his controversial travel ban in his wide-ranging speech.
""Our republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but freedom is a gift from God. It was the great Thomas Jefferson who said, 'The god who gave us life, gave us liberty,' "" Trump said.
He continued: ""Jefferson asked, 'Can the liberties of a nation be secured when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of god?' Among those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs. That is why I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution. I will do that.""
The Johnson amendment prohibits tax-exempt organizations like religious groups from endorsing or opposing political candidates, something Trump often mentioned on the campaign trail.
In 2013, neurosurgeon Ben Carson rose to political prominence after giving an impassioned speech at the breakfast. Carson, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, attacked what he saw as government overreach including in the area of health care, one of Obama's signature policy achievements.
His performance made him a favorite of conservatives, in no small part because his full-throated denouncement came with Obama sitting near him at the head table.
Obama's final speech focused on overcoming fear through faith. The 2016 breakfast came one day after Obama made a historic visit to a Baltimore mosque and spoke about the importance of religious inclusivity.
""Fear can lead us to lash out against those who are different or lead us to try to get some sinister 'other' under control,"" said Obama, making a veiled reference to divisive rhetoric on the presidential campaign trail.

As a result of confusion and conflicting guidance, the ban snared green card holders and people with valid visas alike.

(CNN) Democrats are spending the opening weeks of the Trump administration trying to flex their muscle any way they can -- boycotting confirmation hearings, refusing to work with Republicans on Obamacare and pondering a filibuster of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick.
But as Democrats throw every procedural hurdle they can think of at Trump, they're facing a bleak reality: they have virtually no power in Washington.
The party has no clear successor to Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton who can speak with one voice for the party. And there is no consensus yet on a strategy to thwart Trump's legislative agenda -- or even how to prioritize the issues they plan to challenge him on.
There's one thing giving them comfort: Trump himself. The President's initial actions in office have been so breathtaking in their scope and breadth that frustrated Democrats say their base is galvanized in ways they haven't seen in a long time. That could make it easier for Democratic groups to gear up for a more forceful effort to sway the balance of power in 2018 and 2020.
Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist and CNN contributor, said there was lull after the November election, in part because many Democrats were legitimately shocked at Trump's win. At that time, Democratic congressional leaders were still debating whether it was more advantageous to try to work with the President on some areas, rather than to risk appearing obstructionist by trying to block him at every turn.

706,"THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. These are a lot of my friends, but you have been so helpful. And we did well. The election, it came out really well. Next time we'll triple it up or quadruple it, right? We want to get over 51, right? At least 51.
Well, this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together. Hi, Lynne, how are you?
MS. PATTON: Hi, how are you?
THE PRESIDENT: Nice to see you. And just a few notes. During this month, we honor the tremendous history of the African Americans throughout our country -- throughout the world, if you really think about it, right? And their story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work and faith in America.
I've gotten a real glimpse -- during the campaign, I'd go around with Ben to a lot of different places that I wasn't so familiar with. They're incredible people. And I want to thank Ben Carson, who's going to be heading up HUD. It's a big job, and it's a job that's not only housing, it's mind and spirit, right, Ben? And you understand that. Nobody is going to be better than Ben.
Last month, we celebrated the life of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., whose incredible example is unique in American history. You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office, and it turned out that that was fake news. (Laughter.) It was fake news. The statue is cherished. It's one of the favorite things in the -- and we have some good ones. We have Lincoln and we have Jefferson and we have Dr. Martin Luther King, and we have -- but they said the statue, the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King was taken out of the office. And it was never even touched. So I think it was a disgrace, but that's the way the press is. Very unfortunate.
I am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things. Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who's done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice -- Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. Big impact.
I am proud to honor this heritage, and we'll be honoring it more and more. The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters. And Darrell -- I met Darrell when he was defending me on television. (Laughter.) And the people that were on the other side of the argument didn't have a chance, right? And Paris has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community. (Laughter.) He's all by himself -- seven people and Paris. So I'll take Paris over the seven. (Laughter.) But I don't watch CNN so I don't get to see you as much as I want to. (Laughter.) I don't like watching fake news.
PARTICIPANT: None of us watch it either anymore.
THE PRESIDENT: But Fox has treated me very nice -- wherever Fox is, thank you.
We're going to need better schools, and we need them soon. We need more jobs, we need better wages -- a lot better wages. We're going to work very hard on the inner city. Ben is going to be doing that big league. It's one of his big things that we're going to be looking at.
We need safer communities, and we're going to do that with law enforcement. We're going to make it safe. We're going to make it much better than it is right now. Right now it's terrible, and I saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was really -- you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show. I'm ready to do my part -- it's the only time I can see him. I'm ready to do my part, and I will say this: We're going to work together.
This is a great group. This is a group that's been so special to me. You really helped me a lot. If you remember, I wasn't going to do well with the African American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting -- I won't go into details, but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. And now, we're going to take that to new levels.
I want to thank my television star over here. (Laughter.) Omarosa is actually a very nice person. Nobody knows that, but -- (laughter) -- I don't want to destroy her reputation. She is a very good person and she's been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign. And I appreciate it. I really do. Very special.
And so I want to thank everybody for being here. Could we maybe just go around the room and we'll introduce ourselves. And the press can stay for that, and I'm sure they have no questions about last night because it was such a good launch. We have a fantastic, hopefully, new justice of the Supreme Court. And hopefully, that will be -- he'll be approved very, very quickly. He's outstanding in every way -- academically. He's done almost as well as you did, Darrell, in college. (Laughter.) Not quite, right? But he's a great man and I think he'll be a great, great justice. And he's being very well-received. It was a big evening. Very big evening.
So, Paris, why don't we start with you? Go ahead.
MR. DENNARD: Pleasure to be here, Mr. President. Honor to be here. Paris Dennard. Thurgood Marshall College Fund represents the 47 publically supported historically black colleges and universities, which I know you are very much in support of. So it's a pleasure to be here, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm glad you're in support of me because I'd be all -- I'd be in the wilderness without you guys. You are so effective. I appreciate it.
MR. DENNARD: Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MR. CLEVELAND: Bill Cleveland. I'm a retired Capitol police officer, former vice mayor of the city of Alexandria, and substitute teacher in the Alexandria school system. Glad to be here.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.
MR. MATTHEWS: Bill is also a Vietnam veteran, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: Oh, good.
MR. MATTHEWS: I'm Earl Matthews, sir. I work for you at the Department of Defense. I was sworn in an hour after you were. Also a veteran and a longtime supporter of yours. I've worked for you since late summer. I'm happy to be here.
THE PRESIDENT: Lieutenant Colonel -- good job.
MS. SCOTT: I'm Belinda Scott, Darrell's wife. New Spirit Revival Center from Cleveland, Ohio. Pastor of New Spirit. Great amount of support in the African American community where we are. We love the Lord, we love our new President, and we are praying for our President on a regular basis.
THE PRESIDENT: You know, the one thing I didn't understand about Belinda -- I thought they were married maybe five or six years, because look how they look so young. (Laughter.) Should you say how many years you've been married?
MS. SCOTT: Thirty-five.
PASTOR SCOTT: We've been together for 38.
MS. SCOTT: Been together for -- but in the Lord --(laughter) -- 35, yes.
PASTOR SCOTT: Two years under -- (inaudible.) (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT: That's actually amazing. I wouldn't have known.
MS. SCOTT: But can I say this -- I am so grateful that our President gives us that ear to listen to the community -- to listen. And people like us are just here to constantly put that message out into the community. And we love you for that. We love you for listening and we thank you for that.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much.
PASTOR SCOTT: Darrell Scott, pastor at New Spirit Revival Center and black Trump supporter. (Laughter and applause.) But speaking of the community, let me just say this real quick. Omarosa, I told you I'm going to try to throw it in. I was recently contacted by some of the top gang thugs initiative Chicago for a sit-down. They reached out to me because they associated me with you. They respect you, they believe in what you're doing, and they want to have a sit-down about lowering that body count. So in a couple of weeks, I'm going into Chicago.
THE PRESIDENT: That's a great idea because Chicago is totally out of control.
PASTOR SCOTT: Well, I let him know -- I said, we've got to lower that body count. We don't want to talk about anything else -- get that body count down. And they agreed. But the principle is they can do it. These are guys straight from the streets -- no politicians -- straight street guys. But they're going to commit that if they lower that body count, we'll come in and we'll do some social programs. So they're in agreement.
THE PRESIDENT: If they're not going to solve the problem -- and what you're doing is the right thing -- then we're going to solve the problem for them because we're going to have to do something about Chicago. Because what's happening in Chicago should not be happening in this country.
PASTOR SCOTT: But they want to work with this administration.
THE PRESIDENT: Good.
PASTOR SCOTT: They want to. They reached out -- I didn't reach out to them. They reached out to me.
THE PRESIDENT: I understand.
PASTOR SCOTT: They want to work with this administration. They believe in this administration. They didn't believe in the prior administration. They told me this out of their mouth. But they see hope with you.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I love it.
MR. WILLIAMS: Mr. President, I'm a member of what we call the media, but we try to be fair and objective. (Laughter.) Not all media seems to be the opposition party. There are those that see the good that you're doing. We report it. I'm just honored to have a seat at the table today.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. And it is -- I mean, a lot of the media is actually the opposition party. They're so biased and really is a disgrace. Some of you are fantastic and fair, but so much of the media is opposition party and knowingly saying incorrect things. So it's a very sad situation. But we seem to be doing well. It's almost like, in the meantime, we won. So maybe they don't have the influence they think, but they really are -- they really have to straighten out their act. They're very dishonest people.

MR. DAVIS: Absolutely.

707,"Story highlights The Countering Violent Extremism program connects law enforcement officials with Muslim-American groups
A source said Trump's administration wants to build a new approach focusing on ""radical Islamic extremism.""
Washington (CNN) The Trump administration is working to scrap a program to fight extremism in favor of one focusing on extremism among Muslims, a source familiar with deliberations in the White House said Wednesday.
The Countering Violent Extremism program connects law enforcement officials with Muslim-American groups and was launched by President Barack Obama's administration.
The source said President Donald Trump's administration wanted to do away with the program and build a new approach focusing on what the administration dubbed ""radical Islamic extremism.""
Officials in the new administration see the refusal to focus the program on radical Islamic extremism as needlessly ""politically correct,"" the source said.
The move could face resistance from law enforcement and national security circles. Officials in both areas have consistently said they need the cooperation of Muslim communities to tackle potentially violent persons from those communities.

708,"But whether at least 41 of the 48 Senate Democrats support a filibuster -- blocking Gorsuch from receiving a vote -- depends largely on whether the party's most conservative members, many of whom are up for re-election in states President Donald Trump won, stick with its most progressive members.
In the 2018 midterm elections, 10 Democrats in states Trump won are up for re-election.
Five of the Democrats are in reliably Republican states that voted overwhelmingly for Trump: Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.
The other five are in swing states: Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin.
If Democrats are to block Gorsuch, they could only afford to lose eight members of the party with the first group of five, in reliably red states, the most likely departures.
Some have already indicated they're not willing to support a Democratic blockade.
Manchin was set to meet Gorsuch Wednesday afternoon. On CNN's ""New Day,"" he indicated he is unlikely to support a Democratic filibuster that would block Gorsuch from reaching the 60-vote threshold.

""If you want the third branch of government to work, then you've got to have a nine-member Supreme Court, so if Republicans did something and now Democrats are going to do something, two wrongs don't make a right,"" he said.
While some of their more liberal colleagues have already said they will oppose Gorsuch, Democratic senators from more moderate and conservative states are slow-walking -- careful not to look like they are mimicking the GOP's tactics with the Merrick Garland nomination a year ago, when Republicans refused to grant the Obama nominee a hearing or vote.
McCaskill said she has ""really tried to be calm and thorough about this and for every nominee, given them every chance for a thorough hearing, thorough vetting.""
Donnelly said he will ""carefully review"" Gorsuch's record. Tester sent Montana voters an email asking for their input on what he should ask Gorsuch.
""It's critically important that he has an understanding of the Constitution and is willing to defend it. I look forward to sitting down with Judge Gorsuch, looking him in the eye, asking him tough questions, and finding out if he shares our Montana values,"" Tester said in a statement.
In a vague statement, Heitkamp criticized Republicans for their handling of Garland's nomination, but did not tip her own hand on Gorsuch.
""It's up to the Senate to fully consider any nominees to the Supreme Court and learn about them through meetings and congressional hearings,"" she said.
However, some of the Democrats in swing states Trump won have been much more critical of Gorsuch -- reflecting the push for all-out opposition from the party's base.
""Instead of putting forward a mainstream nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat, he has offered someone who will have a hard time earning bipartisan support,"" Baldwin said in a statement.
There's little doubt where the Democratic base is: Liberals almost unanimously want to see the party's senators fight Gorsuch, no matter the cost.
Republicans have a major weapon to get around any Democratic opposition -- the ""nuclear option.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, could convince his Republican colleagues to eliminate the 60-vote procedural threshold permanently and allow Gorsuch to be confirmed on a party-line vote.
Doing so would also cost Democrats their opportunity to stop future Trump Supreme Court picks unless the party regains the Senate majority.
Still, many progressives want Democrats to take the risk -- making clear to the country and their activist base that Republicans alone are cooperating with Trump. They're already floating the possibility of primary challenges for Democrats who help Trump's nominee.
Tim Tagaris, who ran Bernie Sanders' 2016 online fundraising juggernaut, tweeted: ""I'm just a guy who tried to rub a few nickels together for Bernie, but my gut says there's good $$$ out there for primary challenges in 2018.""

It's not just Democrats in red states that bear watching.

709,"Story highlights Pete Souza was Obama's official chief White House photographer
He's posted images subtly knocking Trump on Instagram this week
UPDATE: Since we first posted this story, former President Barack Obama's chief photographer, Pete Souza, the man who documented almost every impactful moment of the Obama presidency, continues to post images to his Instagram account, and its 738,000 followers, in response to President Donald Trump's actions and policies. A silent, social media, shade-throwing protest told in visuals from the millions of images in Souza's archive, the photos appear to be Souza's expression of opposition to the recent moves of the Trump administration.
In the past few days, as the world processed Trump's temporary ban on new refugees to the US, Souza has posted on his Instagram account pictures of refugees, from a project he shot in Kosovo:
In-between my two stints at the White House, I had almost a separate career as both a freelance photographer and then as the Washington-based photographer for the Chicago Tribune. Both of these life experiences gave me a different perspective in photographing at the White House during the Obama administration. There is a lot in the news these days about refugees. Although it is admittedly not the same as today, I did for awhile document the Kosovo refugee crisis in the late 1990's. I'll post a few pictures from my coverage in Macedonia where many of the ethnic Albanians ended up after being exiled from their country. A photo posted by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Feb 1, 2017 at 5:51am PST
On Thursday, headlines about Trump's confrontational phone call with Australian leader Malcolm Turnbull continued to swirl on Thursday, Souza chose to put up a photo of a laughing Obama, being chummy with New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key, and Turnbull at last September's ASEAN Summit.

710,"Washington (CNN) The future of criminal justice reform hangs in the balance as the nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, President Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, was advanced in a party-line vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday.
Activists worry that Trump, who preached ""law and order"" during his campaign and threatened last week to ""send in the Feds"" to violence-plagued Chicago, would halt former President Barack Obama's reforms, and institute new policies that could worsen conditions.
""The Republican Party right now is divided between people who recognize now that the criminal justice system is a big failed, unaccountable government bureaucracy that's wasting money and lives on the one hand,"" CNN political commentator Van Jones told CNN. ""On the other hand, you have people who want to stick with the same old dumb on crime, lock 'em up policies that have made things worse, not better. Where Trump comes down is not clear yet.""
Trump is expected to move ahead with an executive action this week addressing local crime-fighting and curbing the sale of drugs in the United States.
Here's why activists and civil rights groups fear Trump's White House could turn a deaf ear to racial biases in law enforcement and policing:
Sessions' record on sentencing reform disputed
Trump's nomination of Sessions to be the next attorney general has exacerbated concerns that policing and sentencing reforms initiated by Obama would come to an end.
As President, Obama granted 1,715 commutations for non-violent drug offenders -- more than the past 12 presidents combined. Of those, 568 of the individuals who received lesser sentences had been sentenced to death.
Sessions slammed Obama's efforts as a ""weakening of some of our most important criminal sentencing policies.""
As a candidate, Trump accused the Obama White House of giving ""drug dealers and gang members"" a ""slap on the wrist"" and turning them ""loose on the street.""
The American Civil Liberties Union, a strong advocate for criminal justice reform, wrote a letter last week urging leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a second hearing and cancel the vote on the senator's nomination.
During his confirmation hearing earlier this month Sessions was met by strong opposition from Senate Democrats, most notably New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who became the first sitting senator to testify against a fellow sitting senator at a confirmation hearing for a Cabinet position.
Booker slammed Sessions during the hearing, specifically citing his concern with his colleague's voting record on ""the crisis of mass incarceration.""
""His record indicates that at a time when even the FBI director is speaking out about implicit racial bias in policing and the need to address it; at a time when the last two attorneys general have taken steps to fix our broken criminal justice system ... Sen. Sessions would not continue to lead urgently needed change,"" Booker said.
JUST WATCHED Cory Booker testifies against Sessions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cory Booker testifies against Sessions 02:48
""America needs an Attorney General who is resolute and determined to bend the arc. Senator Sessions' record does not speak to that desire, intention, or will,"" he added.
But former deputy attorney general Larry Thompson defended Sessions at the hearing and applauded his bipartisan work with Sen. Dick Durbin in passing the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act , which reduced the sentencing disparity between offenses for crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to 18:1.
""Sen. Sessions would vigorously, but impartially enforce our laws,"" Thompson said. ""Of all our important civil rights, the rights to be safe and secure in one's home and neighborhood is perhaps the most important,"" he added.
The ACLU said that while the Fair Sentencing Act was a ""a step toward fairness,"" the law ""still reflects outdated and discredited assumptions about crack cocaine.""
Sessions defended his record on criminal justice reform while being questioned by Durbin during the hearing and referenced a similar 2001 bill he co-sponsored, which was then criticized by the Bush administration.
""I stepped out against my own Republican administration and said openly on the floor of the Senate that I believed these crack cocaine laws were too harsh,"" Sessions said, ""and it was disadvantageous to the African-American community where most of the punishments were falling.""
Sessions dogged by old allegations of racism
Sessions' nomination has also been dogged by old allegations of racism, which stem from racially charged comments he allegedly made as a US attorney in Alabama, which led him to be denied a federal judgeship 30 years ago.
While the ACLU says they do not take a position supporting or opposing judicial nominations, the group has contested Sessions' position on civil rights issues.
During Sessions' confirmation hearing the ACLU's legal director David Cole urged lawmakers to consider the Senator's record on civil rights — namely his opposition to the 1964 Voting Rights Act.
Sessions defended himself against accusations of racism at the hearing and said he was unfairly portrayed as a racist in the past.
""I didn't prepare myself well in 1986 and there was an organized effort to caricature me as something that wasn't true,"" he said. ""I hope my tenure in this body has shown you that the caricature that was created of me was not accurate,"" he added.
JUST WATCHED RECAP: Jeff Sessions confirmation hearing (Day 1) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH RECAP: Jeff Sessions confirmation hearing (Day 1) 02:52
And William Smith, a longtime Sessions staffer, defended the senator's record at the hearing, saying, ""After 20 years of knowing Sen. Sessions, I have not seen the slightest evidence of racism because it does not exist.""
But the NAACP, which vehemently opposes Sessions as attorney general, issued an action alert for supporters Wednesday, urging them to contact their lawmakers and oppose Sessions.
""Sen. Sessions as AG is deeply troubling, and supports an old, ugly history where Civil Rights were not regarded as core American values,"" the NAACP tweeted.
Sessions previously called the ACLU and the NAACP ""un-American"" and said these organizations ""forced civil rights down the throats of people.""
Trump supports stop-and-frisk tactics
Throughout the 2016 campaign Trump argued repeatedly that stop-and-frisk policies reduced crime in New York City and in September, he called for implementing these controversial policies in Chicago.
A US District Court judge ruled in 2013 that New York City's use of stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional because it violates the Fourth Amendment and has been used to target people based on race.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed Trump's claim that the practice led to a reduction of crime.
""With stop-and-frisk down nearly 97% from its high point in 2011, crime in New York City is now at record lows,"" de Blasio wrote in a September op-ed for CNN
""Stop-and-frisk was not a driver of that public safety progress. Donald Trump's refusal to admit this and his willingness to inflame tensions for political purposes isn't just foolish. It's dangerous,"" he added.
Despite the tactic being ruled unconstitutional, Trump insisted that stop-and-frisk is ""constitutional"" during the first presidential debate and said that implementing it in Chicago would ""overwhelmingly"" save African-American and Hispanic lives.
Sessions later agreed with Trump, telling Bustle, ""It's all about how that is done.""
The role of police reform
Over the past two years, Obama-appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch launched several Justice Department investigations into police departments around the nation, including Ferguson Baltimore and Chicago , revealing patterns of racial discrimination in policing and cases of excessive force.
In some cases, the Obama White House has used consent decrees to make changes in policing, which require the city to implement reforms under court supervision, whether the police department agrees with the findings or not.
Whether a Trump administration will act to address these findings, open new investigations or utilize consent degrees is yet to be seen.
Sessions suggested during his confirmation hearing that as attorney general he could move the Justice Department away from the use of consent decrees, saying that police departments ""often feel forced to agree to a consent decree just to remove that stigma and sometimes there are difficulties there.""
Trump criticized the federal government's interference in state policing as a candidate and said that law enforcement should be ""a local or state issue.""
""Most law enforcement is local in nature and should be dealt with accordingly. If the federal government can provide assistance in facilitating stronger community relationships, then the Trump administration will be there to assist. Otherwise, state and local authorities must answer to their own constituencies,"" Trump wrote in response to a question from the International Association of Chiefs of Police on how he would work to improve relations between communities and the police.
Sessions also accused the Obama White House of politicizing the issue.

""There is a perception, not altogether unjustified, that this department and the Civil Rights Division goes beyond fair and balanced treatment. ... That's been a troubling issue for a number of years, frankly,"" Sessions said during a Judiciary Senate Committee hearing in November 2015.
Trump slammed the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement as a candidate, lamented a ""war on police,"" and accused the group of helping to instigate police shootings through their protests and rallies against police brutality.
When asked in July if he would investigate ""Black Lives Matter"" as president, Trump suggested that his attorney general would ""do something.""
""We are going to have to, perhaps, talk to the attorney general about it or do something,"" he said.
In a statement released following Trump's election, the Black Lives Matter movement, called on people to organize: ""Donald Trump has promised more death, disenfranchisement and deportations. We believe him. The violence he will inflict in office, and the permission he gives for others to commit violence, is just beginning to emerge.

Tamer is the owner of his own construction company, Tamer Builders, and told CNN in November that he voted for Trump because he admired the billionaire's business savvy.
""Mr. Trump should be held as an image of the American dream,"" Tamer had said.
He's not the only Muslim in Dearborn trying to reassure his community.
Twenty-three-year-old Mike Hacham said: ""I still stand by most of the things that he's doing.""
Hacham is an active community leader in this city where more than 40% of the residents are Arab-American, a majority of those Muslim. In fact, Hacham is the first Muslim to be elected as a precinct delegate in Dearborn. But his active campaigning for Trump has now forced him to be on defense with community members.
""It does put me in a very tough position,"" he said. ""They say, 'Hey, he's going to start deporting Muslims out of this country.' I said, no, he's not. You guys are safe.""
But Hacham is not fully behind Trump's travel ban. He believes it's far too expansive and should be more narrowly written to include what he sees as the real threats, like the countries where the September 11 attackers originated.
Those countries include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon -- none of which are currently covered by the order.
""I want to see the executive order reworded ... in a way that protects the homeland,"" Hachem said.
Hacham said he hoped he could show the President around so he could meet with members of the community first-hand.
""I wish Trump would come to Dearborn. I'd be more than happy to show him around, take him around, show him how we live,"" he said.
U.S. Senator Gary Peters also sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly Monday inviting him to the Detroit-area to meet with Arab-American leaders; Secretary Kelly has not yet responded.
Muslims all over Michigan, however, are beginning to mobilize against Trump's travel ban -- holding emergency town halls with the dual messages of ""resist"" and ""know your rights.""
At the Lebanese American Heritage Club, dozens gathered to hear community leaders explain the practical effects.
Fayroud Saad, 33, is a Muslim whose parents immigrated from Lebanon. She works in the Detroit mayor's office dealing with immigrant rights and is actively involved in all of the town halls happening in her community.
Immediately after the election, she told CNN she was angry about the outcome, but said she was still hopeful about the protections of democracy. Now, however, her sentiments have changed.
""I still think about how I said I wasn't fearful,"" Saad said. ""I guess I've become a little more and more fearful, in terms of not knowing what's next. What's the next thing we have to react to and that we have to worry about?""
Recent University of Michigan-Dearborn graduate Mohammad Emari is also afraid.
The 23-year-old is a United States citizen whose parents hail from Iran. But Emari is engaged to a woman with dual citizenship in Iran and Canada, who currently lives in Toronto. Emari had plans to see her this week, but now their plans are canceled since his fiancee is afraid to attempt to cross the border even though she is a Canadian citizen.
Emari, too, refuses to cross into Canada, despite his US citizenship.
""I'm scared to go myself, even though I am a citizen, even though I was born here,"" Emari said. ""I'm scared I'm going to be stopped for no reason.""",negative
712,"Story highlights Lindsay Reynolds will serve as assistant to the President and chief of staff to the first lady
She is the daughter-in-law of Ohio businessman Mercer Reynolds
Washington (CNN) Nearly two weeks after her husband assumed office, Melania Trump has made her first official East Wing hire.
Lindsay Reynolds will serve as assistant to the President and chief of staff to the first lady, the White House announced Wednesday evening.
Reynolds previously served in the George W. Bush White House and brings more than 14 years of political fundraising, event management and logistical expertise to the position, per a White House statement.
She is the daughter-in-law of Ohio businessman Mercer Reynolds, who served as national finance chair for Bush's 2004 re-election campaign.
The first lady acknowledged a delay in staffing -- the staffing gap has caused a delay in carrying out some duties such as White House tours, state dinner planning and the announcement of her official causes -- among other tasks traditionally reserved for the first lady's team.

713,"Washington (CNN) The West Wing has been churning out news non-stop since President Donald Trump took office, but the East Wing has quite literally remained dark.
It's been 12 days since the last public sighting of first lady Melania Trump, who had been planning on splitting her time between Washington and New York, where the couple's son, Barron, is completing the school year.
And when a solemn scene unfolded Wednesday afternoon as Trump boarded Marine One to pay his respects to a fallen service member's family in Delaware, he was accompanied by first daughter, Ivanka -- a reminder that she is his closest family in Washington.
Melania Trump's last public appearance was on January 21, when she went to the post-inauguration multi-faith prayer service at Washington's National Cathedral. The next day, which coincided with the couple's 12th wedding anniversary, Melania Trump returned to New York City, Barron in tow.
A spokeswoman for the first lady told CNN Trump would be returning to Trump Tower -- temporarily.
""The first lady thanks everyone for their support and a beautiful welcome to Washington. She is returning to New York in advance of the school week and will be splitting her time between Washington and New York for the next few weeks,"" the spokeswoman said.
She has not been back to DC since.
Despite this, a spokeswoman for the first lady knocked down recent reports that the Melania Trump would not be moving to Washington at all.
""That report is not true,"" the spokeswoman said.
Later Wednesday, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, acting as senior adviser to the first lady, confirmed Melania Trump will move to Washington.
""Mrs. Trump will be moving to DC and settling in to the White House at the end of the school year, splitting her time between New York and DC in the meantime,"" she said. ""Mrs. Trump is honored to serve this country and is taking the role and responsibilities of first lady very seriously. It has only been a short time since the inauguration and the first lady is going to go about her role in a pragmatic and thoughtful way that is unique and authentic to her.""
But for now, without a full-time first lady, the typical duties of that part of the White House machine are at a veritable standstill. On Wednesday evening, the first lady's office shifted into a more active gear, announcing the hiring of Lindsay Reynolds, a former associate director of the White House Visitor's Office during the George W. Bush administration, to be Trump's chief of staff.
""I am putting together a professional and highly-experienced team which will take time to do properly. I am excited to be organizing and bringing together such a dynamic and forward thinking group of individuals who will work together to make our country better for everyone,"" Trump said in a statement.
But the first lady largely hasn't filled out a staff, including a communications director and social secretary.
Trump also hasn't formally announced a platform of official causes, a social schedule of events, nor her Washington calendar.
On Monday night, paparazzi caught the first lady and Barron ""running errands"" in New York City. Melania Trump, in a cream-colored coat and signature five-inch high heels, and Barron, were ferried around Manhattan by a Secret Service detail.

During the transition, the President told reporters said his wife and youngest son would join him ""very soon. Right after he finishes school.""
And in an interview with New York Times last week, Trump said that Melania and Barron, 10, would be at the White House on weekends.
The White House declined a CNN request for comment on the first lady's whereabouts. But sources inside Pennsylvania Avenue said Melania Trump hasn't been seen at the White House since inaugural weekend.
She is expected to join her husband at Mar-a-Lago this weekend, a White House official confirmed Wednesday.
Also missing? The first lady's staff.
With spots open for at least 20-30 East Wing positions -- from the social office to the communications team and public outreach -- there have been zero officials hires.
Melania Trump has been actively been conducting interviews for staffing posts over the past several weeks, though, and some names have been floated.

Melania Trump made few public appearances on the campaign trail. She did deliver a high-profile speech at the Republican National Convention in August, a performance quickly enveloped in controversy when it was discovered she plagiarized part of her speech from Michelle Obama.
But her speech also provided a rare insight into her relationship with the President: ""He is tough when he has to be, but he is also kind and fair and caring. This kindness is not always noted, but it is there for all to see. That is one reason I fell in love with him to begin with,"" she had said in Cleveland.
She also defended her husband to CNN's Anderson Cooper when the Access Hollywood tapes were released, calling it ""boy talk.""
""I said to my husband that, you know, the language was inappropriate. It's not acceptable. And I was surprised, because that is not the man that I know,"" she said in October. ""I accept his apology. I hope the American people will accept it as well. And it was many, many years ago. He's not the man that I know.""",negative
714,"During the US President's call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Saturday, Trump objected to an agreement over the US receiving refugees, sources told CNN. All this a day after a call with Mexico's President, where a transcript showed Trump complaining about Mexico's ""handling"" of ""tough hombres.""
Australia is an ally of the United States, with the two countries joining three other English-speaking countries in an intelligence sharing arrangement known as the ""Five Eyes.""
Refugee deal
The disagreement came as the two leaders discussed a deal, reached under the Obama administration, for the US to accept refugees from Australia who are living on islands in detention centers off the mainland due to strict government policies.
Many of them are from the seven countries affected by Trump's travel ban . Trump on Friday also suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days, along with indefinitely suspending the entry of Syrian refugees.
Sources say Trump insisted it was a very bad deal for the US to take 2,000 refugees and that one of them was going to be the next Boston bomber.
Turnbull told Trump several times the agreement was for 1,250 refugees, not 2,000. He also said Australia was asking to submit them to the US for refugee screening, and if the refugees did not pass the US screening process, they would not come.
Trump expressed concern as to how this agreement from President Barack Obama's administration would go forward given his executive order the day before temporarily suspending the US refugee program.
Trump abruptly ended the call because he was unhappy, a source told CNN. White House press Wednesday night, Trump tweeted, ""Do you believe it? The Obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!""
Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017
Turnbull said the call ended ""courteously"" in a radio interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Trump used his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast -- an annual tradition attended by many world and religious leaders -- to weigh in on the reports circulating on his phone calls.
""When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it. Just don't worry about it. They're tough. We have to be tough. It's time we're going to be a little tough, folks,"" he said. ""We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually. It's not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen anymore.""
The Washington Post was the first to report on the details of the Australian call.
When asked about the tweet labeling the agreement brokered with Obama's administration a ""dumb deal,"" Turnball said, while the deal may not have been one Trump would've done or considered a ""good deal,"" the President and his administration have committed to honor it.
Earlier this week, Spicer said the Trump administration would honor the agreement, saying the refugees would be submitted to ""extreme vetting.""
Turnbull attempted to keep some semblance of diplomacy, declining to elaborate on details of the call.
""Look, I'm not going to comment on a conversation between myself and the President of the United States other than what we have said publicly, and you can surely understand the reasons for that,"" he said. ""I'm sure you can understand that. It's better these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you'll see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them.""
One person familiar with the circumstances on Saturday notes that President Trump's phone call with Turnbull came after a long day of conversations with other foreign leaders -- Turnbull was the fifth call after conversations with Japanese Prime Minister Abe, French President Hollande, German Chancellor Merkel, and Russian President Putin, each of which lasted close to an hour.
Trump, this source said, was feeling some fatigue after his first major bout of diplomacy. And while his earlier conversations weren't necessarily contentious, they did involve some tense moments. Merkel and Hollande pushed back on the travel ban over the phone. Merkel felt she had to explain the Geneva Convention to Trump -- a lecture a source has said Trump chafed at.

'Tough hombres' talk with Mexican President
CNN has also learned details about the Friday phone call between Trump and Peña Nieto, who canceled an in-person visit with Trump after the US President insisted Mexico pay for a border wall between the two countries.
According to an excerpt of the transcript of the call with Peña Nieto provided to CNN, Trump said, ""You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with. We are willing to help with that big-league, but they have be knocked out and you have not done a good job knocking them out.""
Trump made an offer to help Peña Nieto with the drug cartels.
The excerpt of the transcript obtained by CNN differs with an official internal readout of the call that wrongly suggested Trump was contemplating sending troops to the border in a hostile way.
The Associated Press report said Trump threatened to send US troops to stop criminals in Mexico unless the government did more to control them, but both the US and Mexican governments denied details from the story.
Sources described the AP's reporting as being based upon a readout -- written by aides -- not a transcript.
Spicer described the call with Peña Nieto as ""productive.""
A government official familiar with Trump's interactions with foreign leaders said, ""(Trump's) interactions are naive in that he keeps suggesting we will have the best relationship ever with a broad departure of countries, but there is no substance to back it up. When he encounters a policy challenge, like with Turnbull, he responds with a tantrum.""",negative

The Utah Republican heads that committee that recently listed 43 items on a proposed agenda for what they hope to explore in the upcoming congressional session.

The list includes other items such as cybersecurity policy, reforming the Office of Government Ethics and spending in nation's capital.
But Democrats have criticized Chaffetz for not prioritizing ongoing questions about Trump's potential conflicts of interests.

716,"Story highlights Republicans see a clear opening to divide Democrats
Top Democrats delivered a spitfire response to Gorsuch's selection Wednesday
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's Supreme Court team whisked nominee Neil Gorsuch to the Capitol Wednesday in a packed day that amounted to one part victory lap and another part listening tour as Republicans try to gauge whether Democrats will attempt a filibuster.
Top Democrats delivered a spitfire response to Gorsuch's selection Wednesday, but the senators as a group remain far from unified. Liberal stalwarts stopped just shy of flatly calling for a filibuster of Gorsuch -- instead sticking close to a message that the nominee should win the support of at least 60 senators before he is guaranteed a vote in the Senate.
Republicans see a clear opening to divide Democrats by focusing on the 10 Senate Democrats who represent states Trump won just months ago and face re-election in less than two years.
Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat likely to face a tough re-election battle, said she was still deciding whether to support Gorsuch. ""I can't imagine I would vote for cloture if I don't want him to be the nominee,"" she told CNN.
And Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, another Democrat being targeted by Republicans, said he was still reviewing Gorsuch's record but, like McCaskill, would not vote to end a filibuster if he ultimately opposed the nominee.

719,"(CNN) President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that debate about what to call his executive order preventing travelers from seven majority Muslim countries and temporarily barring refugees are irrelevant.
""Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country,"" he tweeted.
Trump signed an executive order Friday to block refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations away for three months. Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia are the countries impacted.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer dismissed the idea that Trump imposed a ban.
""A ban would mean people can't get in, and we've clearly seen hundreds of thousands of people come into our country from other countries,"" he said Tuesday.
But both Spicer and Trump have recently referred to the executive order as a ban. Trump tweeted earlier this week in defense of his order, ""If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad 'dudes' out there!""
If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ""bad"" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad ""dudes"" out there! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017
Spicer used the term ban to describe the order when describing it Monday while speaking at an event at George Washington University recorded on C-SPAN.
""One, the ban deals with seven countries that the Obama administration had previously identified as needing further travel restrictions,"" Spicer told School of Media & Public Affairs Director Frank Sesno , comments that were spotlighted by the Huffington Post . ""Two, in the 24-hour period following the implementation of the executive order, 325,000 people came to this country through our airports in 24 hours: 109 of them were stopped for additional screening, 109 out of 325,000.""

720,"(CNN) A landmark deal to settle refugees detained by Australia in the US is on shaky ground following reports of a contentious phone call between Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and President Donald Trump.
Trump is under pressure to reject or change the deal as he attempts to temporarily halt refugee arrivals and ban immigration from several Muslim-majority countries.
Turnbull, for his part, has been attempting to secure reassurance that Trump will honor the deal, signed by the Barack Obama administration.
Sources told CNN Trump described the agreements as ""a very bad deal"" and complained that Australia was trying to send ""the next Boston bomber"" to the US.
What is the deal?
Under the arrangement, agreed by Obama and Turnbull in November within days of Trump's election, Australia would transfer around 1,250 refugees currently held in offshore detention centers on the Pacific Island nation of Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island to the US.
The transfer would be administered by the UN High Commission on Refugees.
Only those refugees in the centers at the time the deal was announced would be eligible. In November, Turnbull said it was a ""one-off agreement (that) will not be repeated.""
Who are the refugees?
There are currently around 1,250 people being held in the two detention camps, mostly refugees from the Middle East and South Asia. The overwhelming majority are from Iran.
Most were detained after arriving by boat, brought to Australia by people smugglers across a dangerous sea route hundreds of miles long.
Between 2007 and 2013, when the current Operation Sovereign Borders campaign was launched, the Australian government said at least 1,200 people lost their lives trying to make the journey.
According to official statistics , around 80% of people in offshore detention camps whose asylum claims have been assessed have been found to be legitimate refugees.
How long have they been there?
According to an Australian government report , the average length of time refugees spend in detention is 469 days, and steadily increasing.
Conditions in the camps are very poor, which has resulted in immense international pressure on successive Australian governments to solve the issue, though domestic support remains high.
In October Amnesty International accused Canberra of turning Nauru into an "" open-air prison ,"" and human rights abuses have been documented at the centers.
Last year, a UN committee report found multiple cases of ""attempted suicide, self-immolation, acts of self-harm and depression"" among children who had lived in prolonged ""detention-like conditions.""
What do the detainees say?
An Iranian asylum seeker on Nauru responding to new details about the call between Trump and Turnbull told CNN: ""We are not toys to play with.""
""People have already been waiting for four years. This process should be really fast we can't take this anymore and if US doesn't want to take refugees they should just cancel it so other countries could help. It's really stressful time.""
Multiple refugees on Nauru told CNN Thursday that they had already had one round of interviews with US officials about resettling there, and were waiting for the second set.
One refugee said a previously scheduled interview had since been postponed.
Neither refugees wanted to be named for fear it would impact their asylum applications.

How did they end up there?
Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) was launched in 2013 after a previous relaxation of immigration policies resulted in a surge of the number of people arriving by boat from 161 in 2008 to 2,726 in 2009.
Even that higher figure is a tiny percentage of overall immigration to Australia. During the 2014-15 financial year , around 190,000 people were granted residency visas, while nearly 400,000 people were granted temporary student or skilled work visas.
The Coalition government, now led by Turnbull, campaigned in 2013 on a vow to ""stop the boats,"" and OSB included posters with slogans such as ""No Way: You will not make Australia home.""
""The government has a policy that it wants to prevent the movement of people by boat from Indonesia to Australia,"" said Alex Reilly, deputy dean of University of Adelaide Law School.
After temporarily housing people who continue to arrive in offshore camps, Reilly said the government has ""been looking for options for resettling those refugees elsewhere in the world.""
""The US deal seemed like a wonderful way to fulfill the promise,"" he added.

With the future of the deal in doubt under a Trump administration, huge political pressure will be back on Turnbull, Reilly said.
""The government has definitely painted itself into a corner by making such an absolute declaration (on refugees settling in Australia),"" he said.
""People are in terrible conditions on Nauru, it's a huge embarrassment for the government, which needs now to resettle people as a matter of urgency.""
While the US deal had acted as something of a release valve for pressure on Turnbull to find a more permanent solution, if the deal unravels it will be very much back on.

721,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump met Wednesday with several African-American leaders for a listening session to kick off Black History Month.
The session was attended by Ben Carson, Trump's nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, his sole black Cabinet pick.
""Well, this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together,"" Trump said, seated beside Carson and Omarosa Manigault, a former ""Apprentice"" contestant and now an assistant to the President.
Prominent African-American leaders from groups like the NAACP or the National Urban League weren't in attendance. But Trump nonetheless hailed, in sometimes awkward terms, the black community.
""Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who's done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I noticed,"" Trump said. ""Harriett Tubman, Rosa Parks and millions more black Americans that made America what it is today. Big impact. I'm proud to honor this heritage and will be honoring it more and more.""
Trump cited as a sign of progress the recent opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington as well as the figures of history featured inside the structure.
One Democrat not in attendance, Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Cedric Richmond, D-Louisiana, downplayed the session as a political stunt.
""It's one thing to pose for a photo op and it's another to offer real solutions,"" he said. ""The CBC has offered the President a number of solutions to address real problems. If he is serious about addressing issues in the African-American community and honoring Black History Month, he will start working with us to implement them.""
But in the meeting, Trump's supporters praised the President for his moves on combating inner-city violence.
Darrell Scott, a pastor who campaigned for Trump, told the President Wednesday that because of his relationship with the administration and Omarosa, he's now set up a meeting with ""top gang thugs"" in Chicago to discuss gun violence and crime in the Windy City.
""I was recently contacted by some of the top gang thugs in Chicago for a sit-down. They reached out to me because they associated me with you. They respect you,"" Scott said as he introduced himself during a roundtable meeting that the President hosted at the White House for African-American leaders.
Trump agreed that this was a good step forward, nodding and adding that ""Chicago is totally out of control.""
Scott, who did not name the gangs, described them as ""straight street guys"" but ones who are committed to ""lowering the body count,"" referencing the high murder rate in the city.
The President has focused several tweets and public statements about violence in Chicago, tweeting a week ago that if the ""carnage"" in Chicago didn't end, he would ""send in the feds.""
Trump reiterated at Wednesday's meeting that he's willing to get involved to stop the violence.
""What's happening in Chicago should not be happening in this country,"" he said.",negative
722,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's executive order to reduce regulations by killing two agency rules for each new one that's added may be more complicated than he thought.
The order also calls on agencies to offset the cost of any new regulation by eliminating old regulations. Exactly how this would be done is not spelled out.
Other countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, have had some success with such ""regulatory offset programs,"" said Susan Dudley, the director of George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center. Such policies, Dudley explained, have ""potential not only to reduce the accumulation of regulatory burdens, but to force evaluation of what has and hasn't worked in the past.""
But Trump's order ""may raise more questions than it answers,"" she said.
David Goldston, who runs governmental affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told CNN that Trump's plan was ""flawed in principle and difficult to implement.""
""Having a new problem to address doesn't mean that any existing one has gone away,"" Goldston said in an email.
And ""given that the law requires that repeal of rules go through the same process as issuance of them and both can be challenged in court,"" Goldston said, ""it will be hard to remove and put in place rules in sync.""
Deciding which rules to slash may pose another challenge.
The most high-profile targets for cuts may be those that cost the most, called ""significant"" rules. The White House definition includes rules that cost more than $100 million or adversely affect the economy. Examples include an FDA rule from 2015 , requiring restaurants to publish calorie counts for their menu items, and several rules used to enforce parts of the Affordable Care Act.
While the federal government currently has tens of thousands of rules on the books, it has published just 5,000 ""significant"" rules since 2001, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Register data, which tracks new regulations.
That included 2,241 significant rules enacted when President George W. Bush was in office and 2,759 during the Obama administration.
In the past 16 years, the Department of Health and Human Services enacted 642 significant regulations, more than any other agency. It was followed by the Environmental Protect Agency, the Department of Transportation and the Department of Agriculture.
The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted the fewest significant rules: Just one, in 2004, requiring hedge fund advisers to register with the SEC.
Many federal agencies have been looking for places to cut regulations for years.
In 2011, Obama signed a series of executive orders to launch an initiative called ""Retrospective Review,"" which requires agencies to analyze their regulatory requirements and draft plans to reduce regulations.
In August, a breakdown from the White House's Office of Management and Budget said the effort had ""removed more than 70 notable regulatory provisions from the books"" and saved ""an estimated $37 billion in cost savings, reduced paperwork, and other benefits for Americans.""
But such reviews are rarely very successful, Dudley told CNN. One advantage of Trump's plan, she argued, might be that it encourages agencies to do more thorough analysis of their regulations before enacting new ones.
But ""often once a regulation -- especially a regulation that's been in place for several years or a decade -- people have learned to live with it.""
Even businesses, she said, ""are not enthusiastic about getting rid of regulations that they've already complied with.""
And even as agencies continue their work of identifying and reducing unnecessary regulations, Trump's plan to reduce costly regulations may face legal hurdles.
Analyses by OMB, which is tasked with weighing the costs and benefits of new significant rules, often find that regulations are a net good.
In its 2015 report to Congress, for example, OMB analyzed 2,851 rules and estimated that they produced an annual benefit of between $261 billion and $981 billion, vastly dwarfing their estimated cost, which ranges from $68 billion to $103 billion.
""The opponents of regulation tend to talk only about the cost and never about the benefits,"" Goldston said.
""Protecting food quality, protecting air quality, protecting water quality, promoting energy efficiency, saving species that would otherwise go extinct — in general, all these things became law because they reflected public concerns about real problems that people wanted addressed,"" he said.",neutral

Trump met with pharma CEOs and told them he wants to see lower drug prices. How? Press secretary Sean Spicer said at Tuesday's White House press conference that Trump's business and negotiating skills will make it happen.
IMMIGRATION
If Philadelphia wants to remain a ""sanctuary city,"" it'll need to contend with more than Trump -- state legislators are also taking aim at the City of Brotherly Love. Philly's mayor thinks being a sanctuary city helps cut crime because undocumented witnesses are willing to come forward.
The Washington Post reports the administration is circulating drafts of additional executive actions that would change the visa process and target immigrants -- and potential immigrants -- who receive public assistance. India responded to the potential H1-B changes.
NPR took the executive order that has caused all of the controversy and annotated it line-by-line.
IMMIGRATION/TRADE
One of the countries on Trump's ban list, Iraq, is the sixth-biggest source of US oil imports. But the ban could damage wider American economic interests. About 6% of US trade is conducted with Muslim-majority countries. Iraq's Prime Minister said he won't retaliate against the US's travel ban.

724,"(CNN) Less than two weeks into Donald Trump's presidency, the United States is staring down the barrel of a crisis echoing the fraught final months that ended with Richard Nixon's resignation in August 1974.
""I have not seen either lawless behavior or civil servants calling out lawless behavior like this since (the Watergate era),"" Seth Kreimer, the Kenneth W. Gemmill Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania, told CNN on Monday night as Donald Trump was replacing an acting attorney general who would not defend his executive order with one who would.
But does it rise to the level of a constitutional crisis?
""No -- not yet,"" said Jennifer Chacón, professor at the University of California Irvine School of Law. ""A crisis would be a situation where there was a genuine concern that one branch of the government was not acting constitutionally and no checks seem to be operating on that branch.""
Every American school kid learns about the three branches of the US government, elegantly woven together by the Founders to provide checks and balances on each other. News of an attorney general refusing to follow a presidential order, or DHS employees not complying with a court ruling, is unusual and unnerving things in a country where baseline political norms and institutional control in government have prevailed almost uninterrupted for decades.

725,"(CNN) When President Donald Trump presents his nominee for the Supreme Court with all the White House pageantry Tuesday night, much more will be riding on this coveted appointment than when Justice Antonin Scalia died last February and created the opening.
Trump's election and the initiatives he has undertaken since the January 20 inaugural, most dramatically on the refugee travel ban, foreshadow years of new controversies to be resolved by the nation's federal judges.
That will put the Supreme Court, and potentially this new jurist, at the fulcrum of Trump's efforts to change life in America.
In addition, the nearly year-long Republican stall of Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee for the Scalia seat has increased the political stakes. This Senate confirmation process begins with partisan payback in the air.
That is on top of what was evident last February when Scalia died suddenly at a remote Texas hunting resort: The Supreme Court is deeply divided and every vote matters. A single justice among the nine can tip the balance on civil rights, criminal law and corporate regulation.
Rarely has there been a moment in American history of such widespread national discord, internal court divisions, and the opportunity for a new tie-breaking justice.
CNN's Jeff Zeleny reported Tuesday that the two leading candidates are believed to be Neil Gorsuch , who sits on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, and Thomas Hardiman , who sits on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Pittsburgh. Both have met with Trump.

The jurist who eventually secures the lifetime post will likely decide the law not just for this generation but for the next.
Scalia, who died a month short of his 80th birthday, served for three decades, and given the relatively youthfulness of the finalists for tonight's announcement, a new justice could sit on the bench for 30 years as well.
Constitutional confrontations
The nation's judiciary serves as a check on the legislative and executive branches. Not even two weeks as president, Trump has spurred a raft of controversy and litigation, particularly to his order last Friday temporarily barring refugees and certain other foreigners from entering the country.
Most divisive is the part blocking entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries even if their visas were valid.
Over his eight years as president, Barack Obama undertook numerous initiatives that were challenged in federal courts, including on immigration, health care and environmental regulation.
JUST WATCHED A look at the current Supreme Court Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A look at the current Supreme Court 01:21
But none of his moves prompted such instant litigation and protest, which played out with demonstrations at the nation's airports and in public squares over the weekend. Lower court judges have temporarily suspended parts of the order.
Trump, who has expressed pride in his disruptive ways, has asserted that the refugee restrictions would improve national security and protect the country from terrorists. Congressional leaders from both parties, along with immigration experts and legal analysts, have condemned the policy. Many say it is counterproductive to security interests and unlawful.
The ultimate arbiter of the constitutionality of Trump's sweeping new moves would be the Supreme Court.
A Polarized Court
On the current bench sit four Republican appointees who generally vote conservative (Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito) and four Democratic appointees who regularly vote liberal (Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan).
Scalia was a reliable right-wing vote, which made the court one of the most conservative in modern times. With Scalia, it curtailed the protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and other racial remedies for discrimination; allowed more prayer in public places; and restricted class-action lawsuits brought by aggrieved workers and consumers against big corporations.
Yet, because of Kennedy's centrist tendencies, conservatives were unable to roll back significantly abortion rights, as established by the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, or race-based policies intended to enhance student diversity at universities, as allowed under the 1978 Regents of the University of California v. Bakke.

Kennedy, who cast the deciding votes to affirm abortion rights and campus affirmative action in 2016, was also the crucial fifth vote to declare a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in 2015
He remains on the bench, but he is 80 years old and has indicated to some close friends and associates an interest in retiring. If he were to step down in the near future, and Trump made successive nominations, he could transform the court and the law in America.
Trump has said he is looking for justices who would reverse Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal nationwide. He has said he wants states to have the power to determine when a woman has the right to end a pregnancy.
Other retirements are possible. Ginsburg, who will turn 84 in March, is the court's eldest justice. Breyer will turn 79 in August.
Recalling Merrick Garland
Senate Democrats and their liberal allies anticipate such near-term potential for change. With Republicans still holding the majority in the chamber, 52-48, Democrats know it would be difficult to derail Trump's choice.
But they appear prepared to make the confirmation process as rocky as possible to dissuade Trump from an especially conservative choice if a more consequential vacancy arises, for example, with a Kennedy retirement.
Democrats have tried to focus public attention on the Republican Senate majority's 10-month refusal to act on Obama's March 16 nomination of Merrick Garland , a former prosecutor who is chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has suggested she would support a filibuster of Trump's nominee. That would require 60 votes to cut off debate, rather than a simple majority for approval.
It's unclear how real the threat of a filibuster may be. Democrats privately discussed their tactics during a closed-door retreat in West Virginia last week, CNN's Manu Raju reported , and some in the party tried to persuade liberal firebrands to let Republicans confirm Trump's pick -- citing fears the GOP might gut the rules regarding the filibuster in retaliation for blocking the nominee.
Responding to Democratic filibuster warnings, Republican Sen. Bob Corker, of Tennessee quipped, ""I've never heard of people filibustering someone before they know who it is. I mean it could be Merrick Garland.""",negative
726,"Washington (CNN) Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump's speechwriter, confidante and the author of his controversial immigration ban, has operated on the fringes of his own political party since he was a teenager.
But after what appears to have been a momentous White House policy coming out week , featuring Miller at its center, that's no longer the case. The California native has brought his views on immigration, multiculturalism and political correctness to the President's desk.
He's also helped Trump in his mission to disrupt Washington, ruffling feathers with the secretive way in which he helped lead the White House release of its temporary immigration ban from seven Muslim-majority countries late on Friday with little to no input from the government agencies tasked with implementing the vision.
But rather than a slap-dash effort, which is how the executive action seemed to unfold, Miller actually spent months crafting the order, a White House official said.
The 31-year-old White House policy director has worked as the key voice in Trump's ear on immigration, along with Steve Bannon , the former Breitbart CEO who is another top adviser. The pair at one point overruled the Department of Homeland Security's more narrow reading of Trump's executive order by directing federal officials to also bar green card holders from one of those seven countries from entering the US. Those legal US permanent residents will now need to apply for a waiver to leave and return to the US, for at least the next 90 days.
The decision to work on the order largely in secret, however, left many Capitol Hill Republicans ""pretty pissed about how this went down,"" one aide who blamed Miller told CNN Sunday.
The secrecy also led to mass confusion over the weekend, as Department of Homeland Security and other officials struggled to parse how to carry out the order.
Defending the policy Monday, Miller told CBS the move would ""make sure that people entering our country truly love and support the United States of America.""
JUST WATCHED Protesters swarm airports nationwide Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Protesters swarm airports nationwide 01:33
But thousands of Americans hold a different view about the temporary immigration ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, evidenced by widespread protests.
The order, however, is perfectly in line with what Miller has been writing, pushing and talking about since he was 16 years old.
Unlike some in the President's orbit who arrived later to the campaign, Miller has been with Trump since January 2016 and served as his hype man for much of the primary and general election.
The sharply dressed aide would often take the stage before Trump, firing up thousands of people with a consistent message: Those in power want to keep you down, but Donald Trump is here to raise you up.
""Everybody who stands against Donald Trump are the people who've been running this country into the ground,"" Miller said at one campaign rally in Texas. ""Everything that is wrong with this country today, the people opposing Donald J. Trump are responsible for.""
That rhetoric was familiar for Miller.
According to people who went to Santa Monica High School with Miller, the Trump aide made a name for himself touting his conservative views with the predominantly left-leaning student body.
""Stephen's whole view of immigration stems from high school,"" said Adrian Karima, a 31-year-old lawyer who sat two desks away from Miller in AP Government. ""His negative views of immigration started in high school and just grew over time.""
Karima, an Iranian immigrant who voted for Hillary Clinton, said Miller was outspoken in the government class, regularly challenging the teacher and arguing that the entire school -- which he said had sizeable African-American and Hispanic populations -- was trying to indoctrinate students.
""He saw it as being outnumbered in Santa Monica,"" Karima said, and viewed his role as ""trying to preserve any idea of Americanism that he felt, particularly by pushing English-speaking first.""
JUST WATCHED Trump Adviser Stephen Miller Clashes with ex-RNC Official Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump Adviser Stephen Miller Clashes with ex-RNC Official 08:42
In March 2002, Miller -- age 16 -- wrote a lengthy opinion editorial for the Santa Monica Lookout that argued ""very few, if any, Hispanic students"" make it to honors classes because the school provides a ""crutch"" to those who don't speak English by ensuring ""all announcements are written in both Spanish and English.""
He also wrote that his high school wasn't patriotic enough.
""Osama Bin Laden would feel very welcome at Santa Monica High School,"" Miller wrote, knocking the school newspaper for condemning the military response to the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, and faulting school administration for being ""quick to preach non-violence.""
Miller and other White House officials declined to be interviewed for this piece.
After high school, Miller attended Duke University, where he again became an outspoken conservative voice.
After college, Miller moved north to Washington, where he began to put the political views he espoused for years into practice. His first job was with then-Rep. Michele Bachmann, the outsider Minnesota congresswoman who told CNN she took a ""gamble"" on Miller, who had no experience before he was hired to be her press secretary.
""I decided I would take a chance on him because he struck me as a very serious individual,"" Bachmann said, calling Miller ""intelligent, hard working and highly competent.""
JUST WATCHED Trump adviser, pundit spar over wife tweet Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump adviser, pundit spar over wife tweet 02:43
One thing Miller wasn't, Bachmann said, was a free-lancer. The former congresswoman said Miller was ""very circumspect not to overstep any boundaries"" even though the Bachmann felt he had ""insight beyond his years.""
Miller would later work as Rep. John Shadegg's communications director and then tied his success to Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Alabama immigration hard-liner who is now Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department. Miller first worked with Sessions at the Senate Judiciary Committee and later moved to his personal office to serve as his communications director.
It was with Sessions where Miller came to be known as a skilled operator and true believer in conservative immigration policy. Miller helped his boss become the most outspoken critic of the 2013 bipartisan Gang of Eight immigration reform bill, penning a handbook filled with talking points on the issue and helping him lead the charge behind the scene to kill the measure.
Though the Senate passed the bill 68-32 in 2013, it died in the House and became a political albatross for the Republicans who worked to usher it through.
""He was relentless, he was constantly putting out new information and that kind of energy and determination when you are David and the other side is not just Goliath, but 100 Goliaths,"" Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said Monday.
Krikorian, whose conservative organization advocates for more efforts to restrict legal immigration into the United States, said Miller's role was ""essential"" to the Alabama senator.
Sessions eventually became the first sitting senator to endorse Trump, sporting a Make America Great Again hat at a February 2015 rally in Madison, Alabama.
The joining of Trump and Sessions -- two immigration hardliners -- cemented Miller's career, and set him on a path to the West Wing and a key position at the arm of Trump.
But in the eyes of some Republicans, Miller isn't ready for this role.
""Why did Stephen Miller fight so hard to put out this order on Friday without talking to any of the other agencies?"" Joe Scarborough, former Republican congressman and MSNBC host, said on Monday. ""You've got a very young person in the White House on a power trip thinking that you can just write executive orders and tell all of your Cabinet agencies to go to hell.""
For those who knew him years ago, Miller is who he always was.
""I see him on TV today and hear about him,"" Karimi said, ""and think he was exactly the same back then.""",negative
727,"Washington (CNN) Tensions erupted in the Senate Tuesday as Democrats stalled several of President Donald Trump's Cabinet picks, frustrating Republicans who accused Democrats of playing politics to try to hurt Trump and make Senate Republicans look ineffective.
Party leaders squared off after a fast-paced and chaotic morning when Democrats on one committee abruptly boycotted a hearing where two top administration officials were expected to clear votes to advance to the floor. In another committee, Democrats forced a delay in voting the nominee for attorney general , admitting it was in retaliation for Trump's controversial executive orders this week on immigration.
Votes on the floor even appeared to get personal when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's wife to be transportation secretary.
Republicans fumed.
""None of this is going to lead to a different outcome. The Cabinet appointments are going to be approved. I think they look quite foolish,"" said McConnell, R-Kentucky, about the Democrats. ""They are manufacturing issues on a daily basis to drag this process out.""
""Our Republican colleagues are trying to rush these through. You know, advise-and-consent doesn't mean ram the nominees through,"" said Schumer, D-New York. ""These nominees are not what Donald Trump promised and not what represents American middle-class values. They are billionaires. They are bankers. They are laden with conflict of interest. Many of them have had very extreme views.""
The heightened emotions were on full display just hours before Trump was to name a Supreme Court nominee to fill the long-vacant seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.
The appointment could trigger a massive battle between the parties made rawer for Democrats because of the refusal of Republicans to confirm Judge Merrick Garland for the opening last year.
Democrats even rejected an invitation to the White House to hear Trump make his prime-time announcement in the East Room.
""I don't want to be a prop in this. I want to take this seriously,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, who indicated he was wary of the showmanship nature of the event.
Tempers flared early Monday after Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee abruptly refused to enter a hearing room and allow votes to take place for treasury secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin and health and human services secretary nominee Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia.
""They are idiots,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the normally soft-spoken committee chairman said bluntly about the Democrats. ""Anybody who would do something like that, it's a complete breach of rule, a complete breach of decorum, a complete breach of just getting along around here.""

But Democrats were equally upset by what they called misleading responses from Price about stock trades he made and from Mnuchin about foreclosures at a California bank he ran
""This morning, the finance committee was scheduled to vote on two nominees who have misled the public and held back important information about their backgrounds. Until questions are answered, Democrats believe the committee should not move forward with either nomination,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden or Oregon, the committee's top Democrat.
The surprise decision to boycott the votes -- which prompted one GOP senator, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, to suggest the sergeant-at-arms should round up the missing senators -- came at the same hour that that members of the Senate Judiciary Committee squared off over Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, to be attorney general.
A votes on Sessions was expected but Democrats employed a rarely-used procedural tool to block the committee from meeting for more than two hours after the Senate came into session. The move infuriated Republicans who had already pushed back a vote on Sessions for a week at the insistence of Democrats.
A committee vote is now likely Wednesday.

On the floor, Democrats are dragging out a final vote on Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state even though he easily cleared a procedural hurdle Monday and is headed toward confirmation. Since Democrats are insisting all available debate time is used, they are forcing Republicans to keep the Senate open late night this week so a final vote can occur Wednesday, according to GOP aides.
Some of Trump's picks did advance Tuesday. Education nominee Betsy DeVos was cleared by the Senate education committee, despite a move by Democrats to invalidate the vote after it happened. Energy nominee Rick Perry and Interior Department pick Ryan ZInke were voted out of the energy committee.
On the floor, Elaine Chao, McConnell's wife, was overwhelmingly confirmed to run the Transportation Department. But contributing to the lack of comity between the parties, Schumer was one of six Democrats to vote against the GOP leader's spouse.
The move rankled some Republicans and raised questions about the ability of Schumer and McConnell to get along.
An aide to McConnell told CNN that the GOP leader was surprised and not happy by this ""shot across the bow.""
Schumer said he voted against Chao because she hadn't publicly stated her position on Trump's controversial immigration executive order issued this week, tying the fight over the confirmations to the latest flashpoint coming out of the White House.
""She has not, so I voted against her, and I will vote against every nominee who does not,"" Schumer said.
Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, described Schumer as typically a pragmatist on nominations but said he was being pulled to the left by the ""Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren faction of the party.""
Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, had another explanation. He said Democrats are blocking nominations because they have a ""mob mentality"" now because they are frustrated and filled with emotion, similar to the way Republicans were when they shut down the government over Obamacare.",negative

""We've fed ISIS a major argument that I think will help them in recruiting and that increases the chances of a potential attack in this country,"" he warned. ""It doesn't lessen that possibility. It increases that possibility.""
That argument, he said, is that the West is at war with ""Islam"" rather than ""extremism.""
""Any time you ban people from coming into this country from key Muslim nations, there's no question in my mind that that ban is based on religion, and who they are,"" he said.

According to sources familiar with internal White House conversations, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus will now take more control of the systems dealing with basic functions, like executive orders.
The way one source described it: Priebus already technically had the authority, but clearly the staff needed a reminder ""not to color outside their lines.""

733,"Washington (CNN) South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham blasted President Donald Trump, saying Tuesday he was undermining confidence in both the American democratic system and himself with the continued claims of voter fraud.
""I wasn't there, but if the President of the United States is claiming that 3.5 million people voted illegally, that shakes confidence in our democracy — he needs to disclose why he believes that,"" Graham told CNN on Tuesday.
Trump has offered no evidence of the alleged voter fraud, and his claim, originally made two months ago, has been repeatedly debunked.
Graham has been one of staunchest Trump critics in the Senate but recently announced he would support Trump's pick for secretary of state, an olive branch to the new President.
Graham cautioned Tuesday that the continued harping from Trump would ultimately undermine his own support among the public.
""I would urge the President to knock this off; this is the greatest democracy on Earth, we're the leader of the free world, and people are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system without justification,"" Graham said. ""This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it.""
Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who scrapped with Trump during last year's election, also chastised Trump Tuesday for reviving the issue.
""That doesn't do anybody any good. That doesn't help him. That doesn't help any of us,"" Flake said.
Rep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican, said he saw no evidence of widespread voter fraud.
""I would suggest the White House looks in their windshield and not the rearview mirror. They did something that nobody thought they could do. They should be proud (of) that and not let this be a distraction,"" Hurd told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""
Republican lawmakers dodge another Trump flare-up
Graham's candid broadside stood out Tuesday, as other top Republicans -- some apparently exasperated -- ducked questions on Trump's latest comment.
Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, repeatedly said ""I don't know the answer,"" when asked how Trump came up with his numbers. Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, would only say ""it's not important to me"" when asked about Trump's comments. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said Trump's claim was ""distracting (journalists,) not me.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was at Monday's dinner at the White House when Trump revived the allegation, deflected a question by saying that voter fraud is real and happens in his home state of Kentucky.
Schumer reacts
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, blasted Trump first, and later accused Senate Republicans of not doing enough to deal with the President's wild statements.
""The President ought to realize he's president. Instead of talking about the election, or how many people showed up at the inauguration, he ought to talk about how many new jobs he's created. It's time to be president,"" Schumer said.
Schumer then pointed the target at Republicans.
""When these falsehoods are told, our Republican colleagues have an obligation to reject them. Not to skirt around them,"" he said. ""The bottom line is simple: you cannot run a government, you cannot help people, you cannot keep America safe if you do not actually admit to the facts.""
House Speaker Paul Ryan -- who has previously fought back against Trump's allegations of voter fraud -- largely sidestepped a question about his thoughts when Trump brought the claim up again in their meeting Monday.
""I've already commented on that, I've seen no evidence to that effect. I've made that very, very clear,"" Ryan said Tuesday.

Brown said while federal law may overrule state law on immigration, California would use its enacted protective measures for undocumented immigrants.

735,"Comey had no intention of resigning, law enforcement officials had previously told CNN after Trump's election.
Unlike Cabinet officials, Comey was not expected to depart at the end of former President Barack Obama's tenure. FBI directors have 10-year terms, and Comey's is set to run through 2023.
But Comey's unusually public role in the election-season investigation into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information on her private email server has made him a target of criticism from Democrats, many of whom believe he cost Clinton the election.
At a reception for law enforcement officials in the White House on Sunday, Trump greeted Comey with a nod to the FBI director's status.
""He's become more famous than me,"" Trump said with a laugh.
In the days after the election, Trump wouldn't commit to keeping Comey when asked by CBS's Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes.""
""I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don't -- I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot,"" Trump said then.
He said ""there's been a lot of leaking, there's no question,"" from the FBI.
""But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I'd answer a question like that,"" Trump said. ""I'm not sure. I'd want to see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.""
Comey has faced intense criticism over his decision to reveal, just days before the November 8 election, that the FBI had discovered new emails on a laptop owned by Anthony Weiner, whose wife, Huma Abedin, was a top Clinton aide, that could have been connected to its investigation.
The last-minute bombshell, Democrats believe, halted Clinton's momentum after three strong performances in presidential debates, and with Trump faltering, and sent Republicans who were considering abandoning the party's nominee back into Trump's camp.
The Justice Department's internal watchdog announced earlier this month an investigation into the department and the FBI's handling of the Clinton email probe.
Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said the decision to initiate a review was prompted by requests from numerous members of Congress and public inquiries.
Horowitz's office said the review will examine several allegations, including that DOJ or FBI policies were not followed when Comey publicly stated last July that his bureau would not pursue criminal charges against Clinton; that DOJ and FBI employees improperly disclosed non-public information; and that the timing of the FBI's release of certain Freedom of Information Act requests right before the election was improper.
Comey is also under the microscope as the FBI scrutinizes late December calls between Mike Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, and Russia's ambassador to the US as part of a broader counterintelligence investigation of Russian activities in the US.
The calls were captured by routine US eavesdropping targeting the Russian diplomats, according to the intelligence and law enforcement officials. But the officials said some of the content of the conversation raised enough potential concerns that investigators are still looking into the discussions, amid a broader concern about Russian intelligence-gathering activities in the United States.
The officials all stressed that so far there has been no determination of any wrongdoing.
FBI and intelligence officials briefed members of the Obama White House team before Obama left office about the Flynn calls to the Russian ambassador, sources said.
At a news briefing Monday, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said he had discussed the issue with Flynn on Sunday. Spicer said there had been two calls between Flynn and the Russian ambassador and that they covered only four subjects: Setting up a call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin; exchanging holiday greetings; offering condolences for lives lost in a Russian plane crash; and a Syria conference on ISIS.",neutral
736,"(CNN) This is what ""America First"" looks like.
President Donald Trump is showing that he is not forgetting the blue-collar voters who sent him to the White House, making clear during an energetic first full weekday in office that his administration will be devoted to US workers.
Flexing his broad executive powers for the first time on the economy, Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that was the centerpiece of the Obama administration's Asia strategy.
He also gave notice that he hopes to get a better deal for American workers by renegotiating the North America Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. The President put a bug in the ear of business executives, warning in a meeting they would face huge tariffs if they send manufacturing abroad. And he huddled with union leaders, promising a torrent of new jobs and factories.
Tuesday, the President will meet with the heads of the Big Three automakers : Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler.
""We are going to put a lot of people back to work. We are going to use common sense and we are going to do it the way it is supposed to be done,"" Trump said Monday.
Trump's moves also reversed the bipartisan orthodoxy advanced by successive presidents that has viewed US interests as best served by spreading American-style trade across the globe through large multilateral trade agreements. From now on, Trump said, the US will seek bilateral deals that will most of all benefit Americans and be quickly terminated if US partners cheat.
His action quickly scrambled political lines in Washington, as he set himself against large sections of his own Republican Party and consolidated his position on economic territory long occupied by Democrats.
Trump's vow to kill or renegotiate multilateral trade deals was an important factor in his narrow November election victories in industrialized states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which upended the political map based on the votes of many workers -- including Democrats -- who feel left behind by economic globalization.
Monday's moves offered a first glimpse of the ""America First"" principle that the President said in his inaugural address on Friday would now undergird every decision on foreign, economic and trade policy.
Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer said that Trump was deeply preoccupied with the lives of people who helped him win last November.
""I think that's where his head's at, is trying to look at those people that come to his rallies, that have come to his events, that he's met with in person that are struggling and say 'Mr. Trump, I'm working as hard as I can. I'm working two jobs, I'm doing everything by the rules, and I keep getting screwed.'""
""That's what he's fighting for,"" Spicer said.
Democrats on notice
Trump's success in transcending party lines -- at least for now -- was evident in an approving statement about his TPP move from the AFL-CIO, the powerhouse union that endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for President last year.
""Today's announcement that the US is withdrawing from TPP and seeking a reopening of NAFTA is an important first step toward a trade policy that works for working people,"" said AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka.
In a political sense, Trump's busy first weekday in office also put Democrats on the back foot. He used the power and visibility of the presidency to impress his midwestern base of union and blue-collar voters -- even as the demoralized party of ex-President Barack Obama struggles to settle on a message to win them back.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer had only a terse response to Trump's move to pull out of the TPP, a deal the Obama administration spent years trying to negotiate but was unable to get ratified by Congress.
""TPP was dead long before President Trump took office. We await real action on trade,"" said Schumer in a statement.
Fast start
The White House understands it needs a fast start since Trump entered office with the lowest approval ratings for a newly inaugurated president in modern times.
Its answer was a swift display of executive power to generate a sense of momentum for his new administration as forthcoming attempts to create jobs through legislation, such as an infrastructure package that many Republicans oppose, could take months.
""I am very encouraged by the degree to which they are going to use executive orders to ... dramatically change things very rapidly,"" said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, at a Heritage Foundation lecture.
Time and again Monday, reporters were herded into the Oval Office and the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing to see Trump in action, signing executive orders or laying down the law to union leaders or business leaders from blue chip companies like Dell, Ford, Johnson & Johnson and Lockheed Martin.
The image of the new President as a man of action was a sign that after a rocky first weekend, which included massive protests nationwide, his off-key speech at the CIA and a new media feud centering around the crowd size at Friday's inauguration, that the new White House was finding its feet and able to drive a coordinated political message.
Dangerous strategy
But it's one thing to maintain a solid public relations strategy. It's another to pull off the ambitious reorganizing of US trade and commerce that Trump is proposing. So Monday represented only a small first step.
The President's belief that trade pacts are responsible for the flight of many US jobs overseas represents a political risk, since higher tariffs and trade disputes that may result could make foreign goods more expensive for consumers or slow economic growth.
Disrupting NAFTA may also be dangerous: Trade between the US, Canada and Mexico hit $1.1 trillion in 2016, according to a Wharton Business School report. Supporters of the pact say it supports millions of jobs in the United States that could be at risk if it falters.
Trump's decision to reopen NAFTA therefore represents another significant gamble. For all his claims to being one of the world's great deal makers, the leaders of Canada and Mexico will be under intense political pressure to seal a better deal for their own people in new NAFTA negotiations -- and are unlikely to simply roll over and allow Trump to win all the spoils.
Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto put Trump on notice Monday for tough negotiations, saying ""the Mexican president wants ""bilateral relationship with US to translate into more trade and jobs.""
While Democrats risked being outmaneuvered by Trump on the trade issue -- which played a powerful role in shaping the party's presidential primary, there remain plenty of other areas of contention that suggest the President's honeymoon with unions could be short-lived.
The President's labor secretary nominee, Andrew Puzder, for instance opposes calls for a rise in the minimum wage -- an issue that glues Democrats to trade union voters. His administration's business-first mantra could involve efforts to weaken labor protections. And if as expected, Trump chooses a conservative Supreme Court justice, he could rebalance the court in a way that could be damaging to union rights.
Trump critics point out that photo-ops and episodes like his claim to have saved jobs at air conditioner firm Carrier during his presidential transition, represent a minuscule step toward creating millions of jobs. And Democrats also Monday accused Trump of hypocrisy for lecturing US corporate bosses on the need to keep manufacturing on US soil.
""I'd remind the President of the two simple rules he laid out in his inaugural address -- ""Buy American and Hire American"" -- two rules that his current businesses do not follow,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor.
""Trump shirts and ties are made in China. Trump furniture is made in Turkey. While he's importuning on others to ""make it in America,"" he should start by demanding it of his own business.""
TPP fallout
There are also geopolitical implications from Trump's decision to pull out of the TPP that could haunt the administration in future. The US withdrawal will certainly benefit an emboldened China and the new administration already appears on collision course with the rising Asian power.
US allies like Singapore meanwhile have repeatedly warned US credibility in Asia would be seriously damaged if Washington pulled out of the TPP.
The case against Trump's action was spelled out by Republican Sen. John McCain, who is emerging as a fierce critic of the new administration's foreign policy.
""This decision will forfeit the opportunity to promote American exports, reduce trade barriers, open new markets, and protect American invention and innovation,"" McCain said in a statement.
""It will create an opening for China to rewrite the economic rules of the road at the expense of American workers. And it will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the Asia-Pacific region at a time we can least afford it.""",negative
737,"The move begins a multi-day roll out of immigration actions that's also expected to include moves related to refugees and visas. Trump will make the announcement during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security at 1:25 p.m. ET.
Trump himself hinted at Wednesday's move on Twitter, writing ""Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!""
Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!
Trump plans to issue two executive orders Wednesday during his visit to the Department of Homeland Security, according to a person familiar with the President's plan.
The first will direct the agency to begin construction of the border wall, as well as take steps to repair existing areas of fencing along the frontier between the US and Mexico. The order will also include a mandate to increase staff at Customs and Border Protection by 5,000 and alleviate the flood of migrants fleeing violence in Central America.
According to the person familiar with the plans, Trump's executive order will require DHS to publicly detail what aid is currently directed to Mexico, an indication of an eventual move toward redirecting some of that money to fund the wall's construction — and giving cover for a longstanding campaign promise to have Mexico pay for the structure.

A second order will work to eliminate so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" where municipal governments refuse to hand over undocumented immigrants to federal authorities. That order will triple resources for Immigration and Custom Enforcement and direct the federal government to identify criminal aliens in the US.
Officials said Trump would wait until later in the week to take action on visas and refugees, potentially as early as Thursday.
An order being prepared for Trump's signature includes the drastic measure of suspending the entire refugee program for four months in an attempt to gauge which country's migrants pose the least risk for US national security. A program for admitting Syrian refugees, who are fleeing civil war and a humanitarian crisis, would be ended indefinitely.
The measure being drafted specifies that migrants who engage in bigotry, so-called ""honor killings"" by males of their female relatives, and violence against women shouldn't be admitted. It caps the total number of refugees admitted in the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000. And it directs the Pentagon and US State Department to plan ""safe zones"" inside Syria, which the previous administration rejected as unlikely to alleviate civilian suffering.
Trump launched his campaign on a hardline immigration policy , proposing to build a ""great, great wall"" along the US-Mexico border and later to institute a ""complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" until the US government could properly vet people coming in.
But as time went on, Trump's rhetoric on immigration began to change and, at times, soften.
His aides eventually walked back the Muslim ban to a ban on immigration from countries with widespread terrorism issues. And while Trump promised to deport all people in the country illegal throughout the campaign, Sean Spicer, his press secretary, said Monday that repealing President Barack Obama's two immigration executive actions were not the President's prime focus.
""First and foremost, the President's been very, very clear that we need to direct agencies to focus on those who are in this country illegally and have a record -- a criminal record or poses a threat to the American people,"" Spicer said. ""That's where the priorities going to be.""

Earlier in January, Trump's transition team engaged in active discussions with the US Army Corps of Engineers and Interior Department to begin planning a wall along the Mexican border, including how specific environmental laws could get in the way, CNN reported.
A US official with knowledge of a visit last month to the Interior Department -- which oversees most federal lands and major environmental laws -- said the transition team was particularly interested in finding out ""how long it would take"" to build the wall given potential legal obstacles.
""It seems clear they were trying to size up the environmental laws that may be obstacles to building the wall,"" the source said.
Another US official told CNN the Trump transition team has also reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers' Southwest Division, that has previously built border security fencing, to determine what previous fencing cost and how it was constructed. The team also asked Interior several questions, including how much wall would be needed, in an effort to determine a solid number of miles of wall necessary to secure the southern border.
Trump's announcement comes as a high-level delegation of Mexican leaders arrive in the US for talks. Trump spoke by phone with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Saturday, and plans to meet with him later this month.
Refugees
The orders on immigration, a congressional aide said, are expected to include restrictions on refugees, and people with some visas from countries including Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. Reuters first reported the details of the executive orders.
Retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, Trump's pick to lead the Homeland Security department, was confirmed last week by the Senate.
In the first three days of the Trump administration, the US admitted 136 Syrian refugees (Saturday-Monday), according to is State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.
""These executive orders will not make our nation any safer, rather it will make our nation more fearful and less welcoming, and such restrictions run contrary to very founding principles of our nation,"" Hassan Shibly, executive director of CAIR-Florida told CNN.
Shibly said CAIR is already getting calls from US citizens, green card holders, immigrants and even visitors who are concerned about whether they will be allowed to re-enter the US if they leave the country for vacations or travel.

738,"Story highlights The DACA program, which Trump vowed to repeal, remains in place
Immigration officials are still accepting applications for the program
(CNN) On the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed to repeal the measure that prevents immigrants known as DREAMers from being deported.
But days into the new President's administration, the federal government is still accepting applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Known as DACA, the program helps undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children get driver's licenses, enroll in colleges and secure jobs.
Many expected DACA, which President Obama created with an executive order in 2012, to be one of the first things to go once Trump took office. But although Trump has already signed several executive orders reversing actions of the Obama administration, as of late Tuesday it remained in place.

739,"Washington (CNN) Senate Democrats are offering President Donald Trump a $1 trillion proposal to upgrade the nation's aging infrastructure -- but he'd have to split with Republicans to get it.
In their first major bid to force Trump's hand on a policy issue where the President's populism is at odds with congressional GOP leadership, top Democrats unveiled their infrastructure package Tuesday.
""We have heard Mr. Trump's talk of disaster and third-world infrastructure, and we agree something must be done. So we hope the President will join us,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference unveiling the proposal Tuesday. ""And we call on the President to persuade his Republican colleagues in the House and Senate to drop their opposition to investing in infrastructure and get on board with this plan.""
The issue could become an early test of whether Trump's willingness during the campaign to break with Republican leaders has carried into the White House -- or if he will show patience for GOP lawmakers through a lengthy legislative process and instead target Democrats.
Before his inauguration, Trump made clear he intended to elevate Schumer as his chief opponent on Capitol Hill -- tweeting that his fellow New Yorker is Democrats' ""head clown.""
But on Inauguration Day, the two were seen speaking at length at a congressional luncheon for Trump.
The two evidently got along Monday when Trump called both parties' House and Senate leaders to the White House for a meeting, too.
""I enjoyed the President and Sen. Schumer talking about all the people they knew in New York,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, deadpanned after Monday's meeting.
Schumer said he's spoken with Trump at length about infrastructure, too.
""I told him repeatedly, 'If you want to do a bill like this, you're going to have to tell a lot of your Republicans -- particularly on the right wing -- that they're not going to get their way,' "" Schumer said. ""And he acknowledged that. So we'll see what happens.""
Tuesday's $1 trillion proposal would potentially create 15 million jobs over 10 years, Democrats said. It includes $210 billion for road and bridge repair, $110 billion for water and sewer programs, $180 billion for rail and bus systems, $200 billion for new projects deemed as vital, $75 billion to rebuild schools, $70 billion for ports and $100 billion for energy grid upgrades.
Democrats said they were insisting on using tax dollars to pay for the package, rather than tax credits, as Trump advisers and Republicans have floated.
""President Trump campaigned on rebuilding the infrastructure,"" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said at Tuesday's news conference. ""Let's do it -- but let's do it in a way that doesn't provide huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country and to large corporations.""
Congressional Republicans for years rejected former President Barack Obama's requests for more money for improvements to the nation's roads, bridges, airports and waterways.
But Trump has sided with Obama -- and even as his aides insist public-private partnerships and tax credits can be used to fulfill the President's vision, he has pledged to eliminate graft, simplify the tax code and embark on an ambitious infrastructure project.
""We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation,"" Trump vowed in his inaugural address.
Already, however, the House's transportation chairman has said no infrastructure deal will come together the first 100 days of Trump's presidency.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters that Republicans are waiting for the Trump administration -- including McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, the nominee for transportation secretary -- to present an infrastructure proposal.
""My understanding is the administration has a team who are putting together a proposal that we can all take a look at. That includes people both inside the administration and I think the secretary of transportation. And they're going to come up with a proposal. We'll take a look at it,"" McConnell said.
""I hope it will be something credibly paid for,"" he said. ""We have a $21 trillion debt. But I think we would all like to tackle infrastructure in a credible way and hopefully that's what they'll recommend.""
Dems look to drive wedge
Schumer and Senate Democrats are hoping to quickly drive a wedge between Trump and Republican lawmakers -- denying them time to figure out how to structure and pay for a major infrastructure bill.
The move is aimed squarely at separating Trump's blue-collar supporters from congressional Republicans.
""That is something that congressional Democrats have sought for years, but congressional Republicans have stymied us at every turn,"" Schumer said Tuesday.
It comes with Trump already using his executive power and visibility to take concrete steps to impress his Midwestern base -- pulling the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, setting a start for the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and taking executive action to advance the Keystone XL pipeline.
Labor unions, traditionally a key Democratic ally, had long sought those moves -- but Democratic leaders, including former President Barack Obama and 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton, resisted.
Labor union leaders also visited Trump in the White House on Monday.
Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, the powerhouse union that endorsed Clinton, heaped praise on Trump for pulling out of the TPP, calling it ""an important first step toward a trade policy that works for working people.""
Trump's early maneuverings have left Democrats sensing danger -- but also seeing an opening. Trump's moves on trade were criticized by Capitol Hill Republicans. And his calls for a massive infrastructure project have triggered GOP concerns about such a program's price tag.
Democrats see the need to exploit that divide quickly: In the 2018 midterm elections, Democratic-held Senate seats are on the ballot in nearly every state in the industrial Midwest, where Trump's popularity with white, working-class voters carried him to the presidency.
The party hopes Trump, already unpopular for a new president, will be toxic by the midterms -- with many Democrats pointing to Saturday's women's marches and the higher-than-expected turnout at pro-Obamacare rallies as evidence that the political tide is changing.
But as a hedge, Democrats are seeking ways to split GOP lawmakers from Trump -- giving their members ways to accuse Republicans of rejecting popular elements of Trump's platform that Democrats support.",negative
740,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has begun carrying out his campaign pledges to undo America's trade ties -- starting Monday with executive action to pull the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
""Great thing for the American worker, what we just did,"" Trump told reporters Monday in the Oval Office as he signed the order.
Here's what you need to know about Trump's move:
What did Trump do Monday?
Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- a 12-nation deal that had been negotiated under former President Barack Obama.
Nothing changes because of Trump's move. Congress had not yet approved the TPP -- its fate was bleak on Capitol Hill no matter what the White House did -- and the deal had not yet taken effect.
However, by pulling the United States out of the deal, Trump fulfilled a campaign promise.
And in doing so, he ends all hopes for a deal Obama wanted as a major part of his legacy.
The TPP -- which has also included Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei -- would have slashed tariffs for American imports and exports with those countries. In exchange, the United States had negotiated labor, environmental and intellectual property protections that major businesses sought. The deal's critics complained that it didn't directly address the issue of currency manipulation.

Now the pressure is on Trump
Trump on Sunday announced he'd start to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. On Monday, he pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
He has now taken firm control of the trade rules he long decried, and is in position to reverse decades of American presidents pushing for lower trade barriers and an interconnected global economy.
In other words: Now, the pressure is really on.
Trump's bet is that, through his negotiating prowess, force of will and willingness to walk away from the table, he can convince other countries to accept terms that previous presidents -- from George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton on NAFTA to Barack Obama on the TPP -- have not been able to achieve.
The task is difficult -- even though Trump's move to withdraw from the TPP is likely to be politically popular. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- a leading Trump critic -- praised it, saying he is ""glad the Trans-Pacific Partnership is dead and gone.""
""Now is the time to develop a new trade policy that helps working families, not just multi-national corporations,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""If President Trump is serious about a new policy to help American workers then I would be delighted to work with him.""
What this means for globalization
Until Trump negotiates his own bargains, he's betting he can reverse the decades-long trend of globalization.
He faces a lot of skeptics. Big businesses are howling that Trump is undercutting their ability to sell to the vast majority of the world's consumers -- a particularly damaging move if manufacturing jobs that have already left the United States are gone for good.
Republicans have long supported free trade -- and now find themselves torn between a protectionist President and a business community that sees Trump's position as detached from the reality that new technology, rising wages and an increasingly interconnected world mean that many manufacturing and low-skill jobs won't return to the United States; that goods are sold cheaper in the United States because they are made overseas; and that American companies also benefit from trade deals, making trillions of dollars selling their own products oversees.
Those GOP principles were on display in the reaction to Trump's move.
""I don't see any benefit in trying to crawl back into our shell as a country,"" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told CNN.
""It's clear that those of us who believe trade is good for American families have done a terrible job defending trade's historic successes and celebrating its future potential. We have to make the arguments and we have to start now,"" Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said in a statement.
How will this affect Americans?
Because the TPP hadn't taken effect, there will be no immediate impact.
Quantifying what it means the United States is foregoing by turning down what would have been a deal including countries that make up 40% of the global economy -- both in terms of jobs retained and business lost -- is difficult, and numbers offered by both critics and advocates of the deal are disputed.
But labor groups -- some of which are scheduled to meet Trump Monday at the White House -- are sure to celebrate the move. They've long argued it would continue a trend of shifting American manufacturing jobs overseas to nations with lower wages and fewer labor protections.
Businesses will also lose access to potential new markets, though. US automakers hoped to see tariffs slashed in Asia. Farmers were set to see the removal of trade taxes that currently prevent them from selling products, particularly poultry, overseas. Pharmaceutical drug-makers had received years of patent protection that would have lessened the competition from generics in Asia. And tech companies, from Google to cell phone providers, sought to lessen regulations and gain entry into some of the countries involved in the deal.
""This decision will forfeit the opportunity to promote American exports, reduce trade barriers, open new markets, and protect American invention and innovation,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain said in a statement critical of Trump's executive action.
What does China have to do with it?
Best-case scenario for the United States: Nothing at all, since China wasn't involved in the TPP.
But already, Chinese leaders are angling to take the United States' place and expand the country's influence in the region.
""We must remain committed to promoting free trade and investment through opening up and say no to protectionism,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.
Obama had pitched the TPP as a way to counter China's growing influence by imposing US-backed labor, environmental and patent protections. China is unlikely to seek or support such protections in its own trade negotiations -- allowing those countries to produce cheaper goods, but with fewer worker protections.
The 11 remaining TPP nations are now set to regroup. Trade ministers from those nations say they intend to press forward with the deal -- but the United States' withdrawal could mean a major rewrite, or an opening for another global superpower to pursue an alternative agreement.",negative

Even during the Obama years, US law banned direct funding for abortion services. But NGOs that performed the procedure were allowed to receive US funding for other programs, including those related to contraception access and post-abortion care.
Now, NGOs that offer or promote abortions as part of their family planning services will be prevented from receiving any assistance from the US Agency for International Development, one of the largest contributors to international development assistance.

That executive action sends signals to Democrats and leaders in foreign capitals around the world that Trump's rhetoric on trade during the campaign is turning into action. Trump vowed during the campaign to withdraw the US from the Pacific trade deal, commonly known as TPP, which he argued was harmful to American workers and manufacturing.
The TPP was negotiated under former President Barack Obama, but never ratified by Congress, so withdrawing from it will not have an immediate, real effect on US economic policies, although it does signal a new and very different US outlook on trade under Trump.
The other executive actions signed Monday included reinstating the Mexico City abortion rules and instituting a hiring freeze for federal agencies.

According to Trump, who made the remarks at a pre-inaugural dinner that included Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Brady called the new president to offer his congratulations before the inauguration. On Monday, Brady was asked if he would confirm he had called him.
""I have called him, yes, in the past,"" Brady said. ""Sometimes he calls me. Sometimes I call him. But, again, that's been someone I've known.

Context: The comments came after the then President-elect took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in violation of longstanding diplomatic protocols surrounding the ""One China"" policy.
China views Taiwan as a renegade province and, since 1979, the US has acknowledged Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China, with US-China relations governed by a set of protocols known as the ""One China"" policy.
This means there are no formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Taiwan -- so Trump's decision to take Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's call could risk a major upset.
For decades, the policy has been the linchpin of the Washington-Beijing relationship, and now Trump is saying it's negotiable.
President Trump has promised to rethink the US' role in the world, taking a cost-benefit analysis to its relationships, especially in East Asia. The ""America First"" theme was on full display during his inaugural address, much to the chagrin of foreign diplomat

747,"Washington (CNN) ""The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.""
President Donald Trump's blunt declaration during his stark inaugural address now becomes a yardstick to judge his administration's ability to fundamentally reshape America's politics and global posture.
The first weekday of the new White House opens a new chapter in the story of Trump the politician. It is the moment the promises he made and the huge expectations he has built begin to stack up against the reality of governing.
To succeed, Trump must quickly stamp his authority on his Cabinet, the government and his own party and sideline building resistance from Democrats -- all while adapting the multiple personal challenges posed by learning the hardest job in the world.
His schedule is full. Monday, Trump has a private meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan, a reception for congressional leaders, sessions with business leaders and union leaders, and is set to sign more executive orders. His agenda is almost entirely open to cameras -- ensuring a day's worth of images his team hopes will show a commander-in-chief at work.
The new President acknowledged the ""busy week"" in a tweet Monday morning : ""Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security. Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America.""
Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security. Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 23, 2017
Trump, who embarks on his term with the lowest approval ratings of any newly inaugurated modern President, must now confront the reality that his campaign is over and failing to live up to the elevated hopes of his devoted supporters will start exacting a political price.
He spent the weekend complaining about media coverage during a visit to the CIA's memorial wall, a top aide suggested the White House simply presented ""alternative facts"" about the crowd size at his inauguration, and Saturday saw a series of nationwide protests against him.
But the real-estate magnate and reality star now lives in the White House because he successfully sold despairing Rust Belt voters left behind in the modern economy on a vision of a nation trapped in social, economic and international decline.
His rationale was that only he, with his non-political, deal-making skills and disdain for political correctness could restore a sense of hope, possibility and US global dominance.
""When I was young, we were always winning things in this country. We'd win with trade. We'd win with wars,"" Trump told CIA employees on Saturday, reprising his theme during a visit to the agency's headquarters in Virginia.
As President, the buck now stops with him as he targets those ""wins"" that he promised would soon start flowing if Americans took a chance on a political novice and self-described master of the deal.
He must now start acting rather than just talking about what he termed Friday in his inaugural address as the ""American carnage"" of lost lives, crime-ridden communities and deprived inner cities.
The challenges are immense. After all, Trump promised to revive American manufacturing -- a goal that effectively requires him to reverse the tide of globalization. His vow to eradicate radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the Earth meanwhile seems like an impossible goal, unless he can somehow come up with policies that no other Western leader has tried over the past two decades.
In an early sign of intent that will herald a sharp change in US trade policies, two sources familiar with the matter said Trump will Monday sign an executive order formally pulling the United States out of the yet-to-be-ratified Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation pact slashing tariffs in a region that accounts for 40% of global trade.
The move is an early gesture to voters who embraced Trump's hostility to global trade deals and belief that the pacts have contributed to the flight of blue collar jobs to low wage economies in the developing world. It also represents a sharp turn away from the foreign policies of the Obama administration since the TPP was the centerpiece of the ""pivot to Asia"" policy.
Facing a skeptical world
Trump is also about to make his first steps on the world stage.
On Friday, he will welcome his first foreign visitor — British Prime Minister Theresa May, who like her peers on the world stage, is anxious to size up the new President and see what exactly Trump's ""America First"" doctrine means for the world.
On Sunday, Trump said he would soon meet the leaders of Canada and Mexico to start renegotiating the North America Free Trade Agreement. The talks will amount to a litmus test of the rationale of his campaign -- that only he can drive better deals for America.
It's unlikely that either Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto will offer much quarter since their own electorates will also expect better terms from NAFTA.
The White House clearly understands the importance of injecting early momentum into the administration, and is planning a sequence of executive actions that will begin to roll back the legacy of former President Barack Obama.
""I think this week, we're going to talk about trade. I think we're going to talk about that a little bit more tomorrow,"" White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on ""Fox News Sunday.""
""I think we're going to talk about immigration this week and we're going to have a time of national security, a conversation about that, obviously, with (Defense Secretary) General Mattis,"" he said.
Trump is also scheduled to visit a Republican retreat this week to glad hand GOP rank-and-file members along with Vice President Mike Pence.
It's going to be a full week. And this president is going to work hard,"" Priebus said.
The White House also says the administration is starting to discuss how to move the US embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to honor a campaign promise, following Trump's call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday.
Given fears of a backlash in the Palestinian territories and likely fury among US anti-terror allies in the Arab world, the embassy initiative will test Trump's ability to deliver, and to live with the consequences of his actions.
Facing a skeptical Congress
For even half of Trump's grand design to be realized, the President will have to stamp his authority in Washington, and flush out the inertia in a political system where little of consequence has happened in six years of partisan gridlock.
While Republicans who control the House and Senate are eager to finally send conservative bills on everything from tax cuts to education and health care cascading down Pennsylvania Avenue to a GOP White House, it's almost inevitable that internecine party struggles lie ahead.
For instance, Trump's desire to confront pharmaceutical firms on drug prices, vision of using government to rebuild the inner cities and ambitious plans for infrastructure spending all run counter to conservative GOP orthodoxy.
And after castigating Washington elites for most of his inaugural address, Trump will rely on them to pass his ambitious agenda. Not everyone is willing to be rushed -- including his fellow Republicans.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for instance Sunday said that he was committed to an ""orderly process"" of repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it — a more stately timetable than that of the President. The Obamacare debate will lay down a marker as to whether Trump has the ability to charm, cajole or bully lawmakers to back his agenda.
Trump must also reconcile the flagrant differences of opinion within his own national security team on questions like NATO and Russia relations because any prolonged ideological duels in the cabinet could hamper his hopes of quickly reorienting US foreign policy.
And while Trump enters office as one of the most powerful Presidents of recent times — given GOP majorities on Capitol Hill, he can't completely ignore the opposition.
Giant crowds that poured onto the streets of multiple cities over the weekend heartened progressives traumatized by their election loss. They might also embolden Democrats to use what limited power they have to further slow the President's cabinet picks, agenda and soon-to-be named Supreme Court nominee.
""If you would have told me that, at this point in time, Democrats would be united and on offense, and Republicans would be divided on defense, when it comes to ACA, or the Cabinet, for that matter, I would have said, you know, you're wrong,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday.
Facing a skeptical media
Given the intense political pressure facing the White House and the complexity off enacting Trump's agenda, it's perhaps surprising the President chose to ignite a new war with the media, over reporting of the size of the crowd at his inauguration.
He complained about media coverage while speaking at the CIA Saturday, and then Sean Spicer's first official White House briefing room appearance was a broadside against the press, which ended with the press secretary taking no question.
There's nothing for Trump to lose politically with his supporters by waging war with the media — and his strategy of exasperating the clubby White House press corps gels with his image as a disruptor who disrespects convention.
But Spicer's frenetic appearance caused some observers to wonder how the new administration will respond to a genuinely high-pressure situation like a national security crisis or natural disaster that is sure to erupt.
And sooner or later, dwelling on trivialities and dealing in what Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway called ""alternative facts"" on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday could damage the credibility of the administration.
Trump's decision meanwhile to do little to reach out to voters who opposed him and are fearful about the implications of his administration means his seam of personal political support will remain fairly narrow.
Therefore, it becomes even more imperative to reward the voters who sent him to the White House — making a fast, productive start to his administration crucial to its hopes of future success.

The strikes, which were later confirmed by the Pentagon, did not require Trump to sign off on them. Under then-President Barack Obama, the authority to order such strikes in Yemen was devolved to the four-star commander of US Central Command, Gen. Joseph Votel.

751,"It's a policy, implemented in the final days of the Obama administration, that runs afoul of conservative orthodoxy. Trump's selection to run the Housing and Urban Development Department, Ben Carson, said he was disappointed in the move during his confirmation hearing. What's more, it was a decision, announced by Obama's HUD Secretary Julian Castro, which was made without consulting Trump's team first, according to two people familiar with the matter.
But the speed with which it occurred -- less than an hour after Trump took the oath of office last week -- surprised even plugged-in lobbyists, congressional staffers and housing officials, according to a series of interviews with stakeholders by CNN.
""Had no idea,"" said one lobbyist with a laugh. ""None.""
""Wasn't expecting it -- and have absolutely no insight into how it all happened,"" said another.
""Knew it was coming eventually, but damn,"" mused a congressional staffer. ""That was quick.""
Carson hasn't been confirmed yet. Trump still hasn't even named his own Federal Housing Administration commissioner -- the individual responsible for overseeing the portfolio the fees effect. Most interviewed were perplexed as to who at the agency actually had the power to pull the trigger on something like this.
The content of the Trump administration's decision to reverse the decision, at least according to Democrats, was even more problematic. The cut itself is designed to ease the home buying process for first time and low-income homebuyers. It was a decision made amid intense pressure from advocacy groups, according to two people familiar with the process -- one final effort by the administration to bolster that specific group of borrowers on Obama's way out the door.
The Trump team's move, especially so quickly after inauguration, infuriated Democrats.
""It took only an hour after his positive words on the inaugural platform for his actions to ring hollow,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor just a few hours later. ""One hour after talking about helping working people and ending the cabal in Washington that hurts people, he signs a regulation that makes it more expensive for new homeowners to buy mortgages.""
Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, tweeted shortly after: ""Making it more expensive for Americans to buy their first homes is not the way to make Washington work for people.""
But Trump's team, in part out of necessity, and in part, according to sources, to make a point to the departing team at the organization, was prepared to pull the trigger on the shift as soon as Trump placed his hand on the two bibles he used for his swearing in.
The primary reason the action was taken immediately was simple, according to multiple people familiar with the process: because it could be done immediately. Unlike most federal rule changes, HUD can operate not only unilaterally on the decision, but without going through traditional rule-making process of doing things like placing the change in the Federal Register for review. A simple letter informing stake holders is all it took to take the action. No official rule-making. No executive orders. Just a letter.
JUST WATCHED Trump signs 3 executive actions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump signs 3 executive actions 02:07
It was also done for marketplace reasons. The cut was supposed to take effect on January 27. If the decision was going to be made, better to make it before lenders started utilizing the cut than after.
""They did it this way so, quite frankly, all the lenders brokers and machinery didn't bake the wrong premiums into the cake,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the former chief economist of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic advisers and then director of the Congressional Budget Office. ""This is the efficient way to get it fixed as opposed to put it into effect"" and having lenders have to backtrack later.
The move was also deliberately telegraphed in advance, according to one official who worked on the process.
Two GOP senators made a point of asking Carson questions about the issue during his confirmation hearing -- an effort to lay the groundwork for the eventual move, the official said.
Republicans had made no secret of their disdain for the Obama administration's decision. The reasons are two-fold: The cut reduces the government's cushion backing the mortgages. By targeting lower-income borrowers, it also makes the makeup of the risk pool worse. Even lobbyists whose members would benefit from the cut knew where things were headed under Trump.
""It was relatively clear where a lot of Republicans in Congress stood,"" one told CNN.
Trump's landing teams, which had arrived at HUD weeks ago, had targeted the reversal early on the process, a person familiar with the process said.
Apart from the logistical and policy reasons, another was general frustration with Obama's decision to make the cut at all. Obama's team hadn't consulted with Trump's before making the move -- or even told them it was coming, the person said. Carson hinted at that frustration during his confirmation hearing.
""I was surprised to see something of this nature done on the way out the door,"" he told lawmakers.
As to who actually did it?
Genger Charles, HUD's general deputy assistant secretary for Housing, signed the letter and is one of the agency's staffers the Trump administration has asked to stay on for at least the near term. Widely respected internally, Charles sent the letter because of her position at the agency. The decision itself was made by Trump's incoming team explicitly, even as where many will end up is still largely unknown or still in the works.
Still, as one put it bluntly (and accurately): ""We're in charge now.""",neutral
752,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump dives into the business of policy Monday, signing executive actions that remove the US from the Trans Pacific Partnership , enacting a federal employee hiring freeze (except for the military), and reinstating the "" Mexico City policy "" on abortion funding.
In doing so, he's utilizing his ""executive power"" — a wide, but vague, set of prerogatives granted to the US president in Article II of the Constitution.
Every president dating back to George Washington has used executive powers in some fashion or another — some more than others.
Trump's predecessor Barack Obama was an avid user of his executive powers. He followed a long tradition of presidents using unilateral moves to bypass resistant lawmakers.
Here are some things to know about President Trump's unilateral moves -- what they can accomplish and what they can't.
Executive Order
An executive order is an official document signed by the president that declares government policy. In an executive order, a president is giving instructions to government agencies and departments about how to operate in a certain area.
An executive order is legally binding, and written into the official journal of the government, the Federal Register . Each executive order is numbered.
Executive orders cannot reverse a law passed by Congress. Limited in scope, their sweep isn't as broad as a piece of legislation.
President Trump can overturn any of President Obama's executive orders, just as Trump's successor can overturn anything he signs while in office.
What would this look life in real life?
President Obama used a memorandum to start the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which was intended to bring people brought to the US illegally as children the ability to come out of the shadows.
He couldn't give them citizenship or make them permanently legal without Congress, but he did give them a temporary legal status. President Trump could just as easily rescind this policy.
It's a two-way street between Republicans and Democrats. President Obama, for instance, in his first days in office, rolled back a ban on types of stem cell research that had been in place by an executive order of President George W. Bush.
How often are executive orders used?
The number of executive orders each president has issued varies. President Obama issued 277 executive orders during his two terms in office. George W. Bush issued 291, Bill Clinton 364, and Ronald Reagan 381.
The most for any presidency was Franklin D. Roosevelt, who issued 3,721 executive orders over his twelve year tenure.
What's the difference between and executive order and an executive action?
An executive action is a broader term, describing all types of unilateral moves by a president. That can include executive orders, but it also includes proclamations, memorandums, and proposals.
Executive actions carry varying legal weight. Directives and memorandums — used to inform federal agencies of administration policy — do carry the same legal effect as an executive order, according to a Justice Department statement from 2009.
But proclamations are more ceremonial, and often don't carry legal weight.
The actions are often controversial. Since the Constitution doesn't spell out any specific terms for how and when they can be used, executive actions are ripe for legal challenges.
How are executive actions used?
President Obama utilized some of these other types of executive actions with more frequency than executive orders. Presidential memos aren't always publicly released and they influence policy less overtly than executive orders. He used these types of memos to extend federal benefits to same-sex domestic partners, for instance. The Washington Post charted many of his actions as opposed to his orders.
Trump could easily roll back some of these. He started with reversing Obama's executive order that reversed George W. Bush's policy. Obama's move allowed US funding for some international groups that used non-US funding to provide abortions. Trump's will ban it.
Congress can meddle in a President's executive authority by restricting funding for a certain program or writing a law that explicitly prevents an executive order from taking effect.
Each president also has the authority to reverse executive actions that previous commanders-in-chief have handed down.
Executive orders and actions pale in comparison to laws passed by Congress
Unlike executive actions, a law begins in Congress as a bill, is passed by both the House and Senate, and is signed by the president.
Presidents have long said they prefer to govern through legislation, since laws passed by Congress can be broader in scope, and have a better chance of standing up over time (since a successive president can't overturn them unilaterally).
Laws also require many more elected officials to sign on in order for them to pass — meaning the president isn't the sole political owner of any piece of legislation.
But laws are, by design, very hard to pass. The minority party on Capitol Hill can stop almost anything it organizes against. And interest groups can target lawmakers to influence their votes. It can take years of planning and lobbying to find the right moment to pass a piece of legislation. The president's actions, while temporary and limited, can be enacted with the stroke of a pen.",neutral

Late last year Trump ended his dispute with certain labor unions and former students of Trump University . Other cases -- such as the former refugee who sued Trump for copyright infringement over a Skittles tweet or the breach of contract claim brought by a kids' dancing troupe -- went away more quietly, with the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissing complaints.
But several other lawsuits did not settle before Inauguration Day -- leaving the President not only exposed to potential financial liability, but facing future depositions or even a trial or two while office.
Then, just three days into his presidency, Trump was sued by a non-partisan ethics accountability group for allegedly accepting payments from foreign governments through his business empire in violation of the Constitution.
Here's an updated rundown of some of the more interesting cases Trump brought with him to the Oval Office:
Restaurant deals gone wrong
Jose Andrés and Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of agreements to open restaurants in Trump's Washington hotel following Trump's 2015 reference to some Mexican immigrants as ""rapists."" Trump sued the chefs for breach of contract, seeking over $10 million in damages apiece, and they countersued.
Trump was deposed in the Zakarian suit last year, and was forced by a judge to sit for brief deposition in the Andrés case smack in the middle of the transition earlier this month.
While Andrés repeatedly suggested on Twitter that the parties bring their lawsuit to an end, Trump never responded publicly.
Again Mr. Peotus @realDonaldTrump if you are awake, let's resolve this in a friendly way. We donate $ to a charity, 🤝😀..? Is a great deal! — José Andrés (@chefjoseandres) January 5, 2017
Security issues at rallies
During the campaign, Trump referred to his rallies as the ""safest place on Earth,"" but he faces a number of lawsuits from those who claim to have experienced threats or violence at the hands of his security and campaign teams.
In March, three protestors claimed they were called derogatory names, shoved and punched at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky, after Trump directed the audience to ""get 'em out of here.""
The plaintiffs filed a complaint against Trump and two of his supporters, Trump's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, but the judge has yet to rule. Plaintiffs' attorney Greg Belzley told CNN last month that if the judge denies Trump's motion to dismiss, he will seek to depose the incoming president.
In a separate lawsuit, two men in Alabama sued the Trump campaign, several of his security personnel and the Birmingham Jefferson Convention Center, alleging in the complaint that they were ""assaulted and beaten by an angry mob that had been incited by Donald J. Trump"" at a rally in Birmingham.
In September, five Mexican human rights activists filed suit against Trump, his campaign and his chief of security, Keith Schiller, among others. The plaintiffs allege that Trump security officials, namely Schiller, assaulted them as they protested outside of Trump Tower in New York. Trump has not been deposed in the case and no trial date has been set.
Finally, a former Trump campaign staffer claims that Trump's North Carolina state director pulled a gun on him, and the campaign did nothing about it after the staffer reported the incident. Described in the complaint as a ""passionate"" Trump supporter, Vincent Bordini sued the Trump campaign and Earl Phillip, the state director, in August, asserting several causes of action, including battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent supervision. A trial date has been set for July and the parties remain in discovery.
Complaints at Trump's golf clubs
Trump currently faces multiple suits related to his golf clubs.
One dates back to 2013 in which members of the Jupiter Golf Club claim they were stripped of their refundable deposits after Trump's company acquired The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club & Spa Jupiter in Florida and changed the terms of membership. Both Donald and Eric Trump were deposed in the matter, it went to trial before a judge in August, but the parties are still awaiting a ruling.
In an unrelated case, a woman filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Jupiter in June, alleging she endured persistent unwelcome advances from the food and beverage director of the club, and was then retaliated against for reporting him. The parties have submitted a joint scheduling order proposing a December 2017 trial date in that matter.
Then there is the case of a former maintenance worker at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey who claimed he faced intense harassment after coming out to his co-workers as gay, including having golf balls and rocks ""routinely"" thrown at him, according to court papers.
Melania v. Daily Mail
The new first lady has not shied away from lawsuits herself. Last fall, Melania Trump threatened to sue People magazine for an article accusing her husband of forcing himself on a reporter.
Then in September, she sued the Daily Mail for defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an ""escort"" in the 1990s. The paper printed a retraction, but the lawsuit appears to be moving full steam ahead, with Melania Trump seeking $150 million in damages and even making an in-person appearance at a routine court hearing last month.

758,"Washington (CNN) Beyond the empty seats filled a day earlier by President Donald Trump's VIPs, far past the stage where celebrities and activists headlining Saturday's Women's March took turns delivering campaign-style speeches, a smaller gathering of protesters blocks from Pennsylvania Avenue quietly strained for a view of the White House's South Portico.
The mass demonstrations that consumed Washington on Trump's first full day in office were a defiant and at times wide-eyed display -- an implicit rebuke to the portrait of ""American carnage"" that colored Trump's grim address . Thousands of marchers, women and men, wore pink knit ""pussy hats"" and waved mischievous signs written over with warnings to the man whose new home they had effectively choked off from the city.
But they also arrived as tourists -- and gazed on the capital's formidable architecture with a mix of anger and awe.
For many, the march represented a first foray into pavement politics. Enraged by the new president's remarks about women on the campaign trail -- and his bragging, caught in a 2005 video, that he ""grabs"" women ""by the pussy"" -- they lashed out against the administration with the passion of converts.
""This is actually my first protest,"" Braydee Euliss, who drove to Washington from Muncie, Indiana, told CNN. ""I'm here now because I not only stand to lose personally, but women collectively and women of color especially, stand to lose, too.""

759,"Washington (CNN) While remaining committed to relocating the US Embassy to Jerusalem, the Trump administration is expected to move cautiously on a timeline as it focuses on critical issues in the American relationship with the Israeli government and consults with allies about the way forward, senior administration, Israeli and diplomatic sources tell CNN.
The White House confirmed President Donald Trump invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington in early February in a phone call between the two leaders Sunday.
A senior administration official said that moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv remains a priority for the president but cautioned that it would not be happen quickly. No announcements are expected Monday or in the coming days, the official said, adding that working on the issue will be one of the first tasks awaiting Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and son-in-law to Trump.
The mayor of Jerusalem, Nir Barkat, told Israeli Army Radio on Monday that he is in contact with the White House about moving the embassy to Jerusalem.
""I do know, from the talks I've been holding with members of the American administration, that they are serious about their intention,"" Barkat said. ""They have several assets in Jerusalem that could provide a solution. I definitely think that you don't move an embassy in a day.""

Arab and European diplomats said there have been signs Trump and his advisers could slow down implementing a formal relocation amid warnings from Arab and European officials to the incoming administration that the move could unleash violence, undermine the peace process, damage US standing in the Middle East, and endanger American personnel. They have urged the incoming administration to consult with allies about the move and put it in the context of a broader strategy toward addressing the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer stressed Sunday the administration was in the beginning stages of discussions regarding Trump's campaign pledge to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Spicer, asked whether a move will be announced soon, told reporters: ""We are at the very beginning stages of even discussing this subject."" Last week Spicer said ""there would be a further announcement"" on moving the embassy, saying ""the president has made clear that Israel has not gotten the respect it deserves.""
Yet the subject of the embassy move, which would represent a major change in US policy, was not the focus of the call Sunday between Trump and Netanyahu, administration and Israeli officials said. Statements from both governments about the call did not even mention the issue, saying the two leaders spoke about Iran, Syria and peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
In a statement after the phone call, the White House said Trump ""affirmed his unprecedented commitment to Israel's security"" and said he invited Netanyahu to an early February meeting at the White House.
""The President emphasized that peace between Israel and the Palestinians can only be negotiated directly between the two parties, and that the United States will work closely with Israel to make progress towards that goal. The President invited Prime Minister Netanyahu to an early February meeting at the White House,"" the statement said.
While Israel has long wanted the US to move the embassy and has welcomed Trump's pledge, top Israeli officials have said the issue is not the most important in the relationship, stressing the threat posed by Iran, the violence in Syria and the need for Israel to improve its relations with Arab states remained the government's top priorities.
Netanyahu's office said the two leaders had a ""very warm conversation"" and pledged to ""work closely with President Trump to forge a common vision to advance peace and security in the region, with no daylight between the United States and Israel.""
Shortly after a White House staff swearing-in ceremony, Trump told a pool reporter he had a ""very nice"" call with Netanyahu. He ignored a shouted question about moving the embassy.

On Thursday, Trump assured Israel that he is committed to making good on his campaign pledge to move the embassy, telling the newspaper Israel Hayom, ""of course I remember what I told you about Jerusalem ... and you know I'm not a person who breaks promises.""
With scant discussion with the incoming administration about its actual plans for the embassy, Netanyahu convened his national security team and ordered Israeli security services to prepare for possible scenarios of worsening violence if the Trump administration made an early announcement upon taking office. The meeting came amid Palestinian efforts to head off an embassy move, writing world leaders and increasing media outreach. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met Jordanian King Abdullah II in Amman on Sunday to coordinate moves against the possible relocation of the embassy.
In the weeks leading up to his inauguration, Trump's advisers had floated the possibility of initially having the US ambassador to Israel work and live in the US consulate in Jerusalem, while the American Embassy remains in Tel Aviv. Diplomatic sources said such a plan could be a compromise -- that allows Trump to move on fulfilling his pledge on Jerusalem -- which Israel and the Palestinians both claim as their capital -- without starting his term with a firestorm a formal relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv would almost certainly bring.
Trump has named New York lawyer David Friedman as his ambassador to Israel, pending Senate confirmation.
Among the options being considered are for Friedman to begin work Jerusalem, either from a hotel suite or a designated office in the US consulate.
Friedman, who already maintains a home in Jerusalem, has long been a proponent of moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and, upon being named, said he looked forward to working ""from the US Embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem.""
The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act calls on the US to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the embassy there. But the law allows for the move to be waived if the President deems it harmful to US national security interests. Since it passed, every US president -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- has signed the waiver every six months, even though Bush and Clinton had promised to move the embassy during their presidential campaigns. Earlier this month, Obama renewed a presidential waiver delaying the move for another six months, citing ""national security interests."" The waiver expires June 1.
Israeli sources have suggested the May 24 Israeli holiday of ""Jerusalem Day"" as a possible date for a more official move toward relocation. That national holiday commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem and the establishment of Israeli control over the Old City following the June 1967 Six Day War and typically is marked by ceremonies and memorial services.
Diplomats suggested that once the administration is in office for a few months, the threat of more chaos in the Middle East and the need not to alienate US Arab allies may cause a newly-minted President Trump to sing a different tune.

761,"Washington (CNN) The moment Donald Trump became the 45th President, some legal experts say he triggered a violation of the foreign emoluments clause in the Constitution, flouted the plain terms of the lease for his Washington hotel, and opened himself up to a dizzying array of ethical questions on financial conflicts of interests.
For months, a vocal group of constitutional lawyers, ethics law scholars and Democrats on Capitol Hill have urged Trump to avoid the legal perplexities posed by his vast business enterprises and divest his assets into a truly blind trust (or the equivalent).
His response?
""The law is totally on my side, meaning, the President can't have a conflict of interest,"" Trump told The New York Times
""I have have a no conflict situation because I'm President ... it's a nice thing to have,"" he repeated to reporters at a news conference earlier this month.
Trump instead pledged to resign from management of the Trump Organization, but according to an investigation by ProPublica apparently has not done so yet; promised to put his investments into some type of trust controlled by his two adult sons, but will not sell off his business holdings; and still refuses to release his taxes, but said he will hire an in-house ethics adviser.
The Trump hotel, emoluments and conflicts
Of all the potential legal problems posed by Trump's financial holdings, none is more immediate and complicated than the hotel he opened in the Old Post Office in DC.
The Trump Organization leased the property from the federal General Services Administration in 2013, but a clause in the lease states that no ""elected official of the government ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.""
As of Saturday night, the GSA has not declared the Trump Organization in breach of the contract, and declined to comment on the status of any negotiations to resolve the apparent breach.
The Trump Organization and the White House also did not respond to requests for comment.
But at least one liberal group was quick to file a complaint
""Elected government officials are barred from receiving any benefit under the lease, and now that Mr. Trump has been sworn in today as President of the United States, Trump Old Post Office LLC, a company he largely owns, is in violation of the lease's conflicts-of-interest provision,"" wrote the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in a letter to the GSA.
""This is bad as it gets,"" said Norm Eisen, who served as a chief White House ethics lawyer in the Obama administration.
The hotel's Twitter account, on the other hand, exclaimed Friday: ""We are waiting for you Mr. President! Thank you!""
Assume for a moment that the GSA does not move to terminate the lease (at least not right away), and Trump retains his interest in the hotel -- experts say he still has a more profound constitutional problem on his hands under the foreign emoluments clause starting on Day 1 in Oval Office.
The main complaint here is that when a foreign official stays at the Trump hotel, they will be giving him an emolument -- i.e., money -- violating Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution, which states that ""no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under (the United States), shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.""
Trump's lawyers said in a white paper released earlier this month that ""the Constitution does not forbid fair-market-value transactions with foreign officials.""
But an outspoken group of ethics lawyers say allowing foreign diplomats to curry favor with Trump by using his hotels would defeat the entire purpose of the emoluments clause.
Eisen has teamed up with former White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter under President George W. Bush, along with Harvard Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe, to argue that the emoluments clause ""covers even ordinary, fair market value transactions that result in any economic profit or benefit"" to the President.
In other words: ""Trump can't receive any direct payment of any kind from a foreign government, including a fee for services,"" agrees Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman
So yes, those expensive drinks at the hotel bar count. As does the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.'s lease payments for space in Trump Tower.
Who has the power to resolve these issues?
Given all of these weighty legal issues facing Trump's presidency, the natural question for many is: Who has standing to enforce a Constitutional violation?
The short answer is Congress.
""Congress would be well within its rights to impeach him for engaging in 'high crimes and misdemeanors',"" according to Eisen, Painter and Tribe if there was reason to believe Trump violated the emoluments clause.
Congress could also create a brand new cause of action allowing private parties -- think business competitors -- to file suit.
But given that both the House and Senate remain under Republican control, the likelihood of action on either front is unlikely at best.
At the end of the day, many experts say it might simply be left up to the voters if the President and Congress do not adequately address these issues.
""How the public reacts may depend on whether it appears the conflicts are affecting decisions,"" Noble said. ""This is why we expect the president to follow certain norms and not try to push the legal envelope on ethics rules.""",negative

766,"Washington (CNN) Prime real estate in the Trump White House, hiccups and help in filling important jobs, making sure agencies know who is boss -- and a big question for the now former President Barack Obama. It's all part of the Inside Politics forecast.
1) Location, location, location
President Trump understands a key metric in real estate value -- location.
It is true in Manhattan -- a corner condo on a high floor is going to cost more than a basement unit near the elevator. And it is certainly true in the White House. Even a tiny spot next to the Oval Office is more coveted than a larger space upstairs in the West Wing.
CNN's Jeff Zeleny took us through the competition in the new Trump power structure, including presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner's move into a tiny space that offers the closest proximity to the President.
""Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, I'm told will have the chief of staff's office, which has a fireplace as we all know, long conference table, access to outside,"" revealed Zeleny.
""I'm told that Jared Kushner will be sitting in a smaller office, but the one that is closest to the Oval Office.""
2) A frequent Trump critic comes to his aid in CIA fight
Gen. Michael Hayden has a long track record in public service, including a stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and has been a frequent critic of President Trump during his running battle with America's spy agencies and his campaign season affinity for Vladimir Putin.
JUST WATCHED Hayden on the Pompeo process: Why the holdup? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hayden on the Pompeo process: Why the holdup? 00:38
But he is a Trump ally in one important fight -- the effort to get Kansas Republican Rep Mike Pompeo confirmed as the next CIA chief.
Mary Katharine Ham of The Federalist detailed General Hayden's cases for swift confirmation.
""(Hayden) said (Pompeo) is going to follow the law and come to Congress if he thinks there should be a change,"" says Ham.
""It's interesting because there's been so much fire between the CIA and Trump that on the other side, a respected veteran is coming out and saying, ""Look, let's get this moving. the national security operation is important.""
3) Trump team keeping an eye on agencies
The Trump White House did not appreciate it when the National Park Service Twitter account retweeted a New York Times comparison noting that President Obama has a bigger crowd for his 2009 Inaugural than President Trump had for his on Friday.
JUST WATCHED How team Trump will handle agency takeovers Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How team Trump will handle agency takeovers 00:40
So word went put for the agency to stand down -- and stop tweeting.
Not likely to be a significant moment when we look back in 100 days and assess the administration's start. But Peter Baker of The New York Times called it an episode worth watching as we see how strong a hand the new White House will try to take over the minute-to-minute actions of far flung government agencies.
""My colleague from the New York Times tweeted out on Friday pictures we've all been looking at of the different inaugurations.
It was then retweeted by the National Park Service, which is normally in charge of that patch of ground and they got in trouble for that,"" reports Baker.
""The Trump people didn't like that and the National Park Service went offline. It's a really interesting period; agencies in the government, which are probably pretty suspicious of this new president, to watch them deal with a new president who is pretty suspicious of them.""
4) Help wanted: Important vacancies remain unfilled
As prospective Trump Cabinet members get their hearings on Capitol Hill, there is a scramble to find key deputies across the sprawling federal bureaucracy.
There are worries in GOP circles that team Trump is running behind in making these choices -- and stories across Washington that one issue is getting people to say yes.
Top Trump aides say not to worry, and promise a steady stream of announcements in the days ahead.
But the Treasury Department is one example. Steven Mnuchin is the Wall Street veteran tapped to lead the department. CNN is told he wants a veteran Washington hand as his top deputy, but was unsuccessful in his first foray. GOP sources say the Trump transition team identified Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling as a good fit. But word is Hensarling -- who was considered but not chosen for the top Treasury job -- said he wasn't interested.
5) The party needs a leader -- will Obama weigh in?
Barack Obama is now a former president and private citizen but promises to step into some political battles if he deems it right or necessary. A big question in Washington is whether his list includes the race to lead the Democratic National Committee.
We know Obama's favorite in the race is Tom Perez, who was most recently Obama's labor secretary.
But will the former president work the phones and twist arms to help Perez round up votes?
CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson explored the dynamics.
""His guy, Tom Perez, the former labor secretary, is running as well as Michael Blake who is running as the vice chair; he is an Obama staffer. [Obama] has said very complimentary things about both,"" explains Henderson.
""Michael Blake is actually using some of Obama's former fundraisers in Chicago to fund his race. it will be interesting to see if he officially endorses and if it matters.""",negative
767,"Story highlights Rep. Devin Nunes said he doesn't blame Trump for complaining about leaks
Nunes' comments come after Trump visited CIA headquarters
Washington (CNN) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-California, said Sunday he doesn't blame President Donald Trump for complaining about leaks from the intelligence community.
""You're going to see at the highest level of the past administration, at that level, I think, Donald Trump had a lot of problems with, and I don't blame him for having a lot of problems -- there were a lot of leaks,"" Nunes told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""
Nunes said leaks in the last 60 to 90 days before the election occurred were attributable to ""the Obama administration directly or the intelligence community.""
Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, issued a statement saying: ""I do not believe the leaks came from within the (intelligence community).""
Nunes comments were made after former CIA Director John Brennan criticized Trump's Saturday speech at the CIA.

768,"Story highlights Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said he opposes at least eight Trump Cabinet picks
Schumer said Democrats could try to block the confirmation of Trump's Supreme Court pick
Washington (CNN) Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday he opposes eight or nine of President Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees -- and could also attempt to block his eventual Supreme Court nominee.
""If the nominee is out of the mainstream, we will do our best to keep the seat open,"" Schumer, D-New York, told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" of the Supreme Court vacancy that Trump will get a shot at filling after majority Republicans blocked former President Barack Obama's nominee for a year.
""I'm hopeful that President Trump may nominate someone who is mainstream and could get bipartisan support,"" Schumer said. ""But if they don't, yes, we will fight it tooth and nail, as long as we have to.""
Schumer also said he'll oppose eight or nine of Trump's Cabinet nominees, and potentially more.
He specifically said he opposes Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Trump's nominee to helm the Environmental Protection Agency.

769,"Washington (CNN) It's going to be impossible to gauge how many people exactly attended the inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017 as opposed to Barack Obama in 2009.
It's also going to be impossible to gauge how many people exactly attended Trump's inauguration as opposed to the Women's March Saturday organized as a direct rebuttal to Trump the previous day.

But there's going to be a lot of conjecture about it. Trump himself talked about his massive crowds during an appearance at the Armed Services Ball Friday night.
It's clear that both events attracted many people. Below are pictures from 12:15 p.m. ET on each day from the EarthCam website.

Trump talked about crowd size during an appearance at the CIA Saturday and argued the size of his crowds had been misrepresented.
""We had a massive field of people,"" he told the US intelligence agency. ""You saw that. Packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. I'm like, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well,"" the President said.
""It looked honestly like a million and a half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to the Washington Monument and I turn on, by mistake, I get this network, and it showed an empty field. Said we drew 250,000 people. Now, that's not bad. But it's a lie. We had 250,000 people,"" he said.
It wasn't clear which outlet Trump was referring to. CNN has not reported a specific size to the crowd since there has been no official estimate.
Trump took the oath of office just before noon Friday and then gave his inaugural address. A rally associated with the march was slated for between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Saturday.
Some differences to note: Trump's speech was on the West Front of the Capitol, which was at capacity on Friday. It was cordoned off and empty on Saturday as protesters gathered on the Mall.
On the other hand, the Women's March filled the streets around the mall. Those streets were closed to Trump supporters.
His inauguration was on Jan. 20, because of the Constitution, which this year occurred on a Friday. The Women's March was on Saturday, when more people are off work.
Metro, Washington's subway system, tweeted Saturday there were 275,000 trips taken Saturday by 11 a.m.
Metro Ridership as of 11am: 275k. For comparison, that's more than 8x a normal Sat & even busier than most weekdays. #wmata #womensmarch — Metro (@wmata) January 21, 2017

Another important point: Both events are occurring in an area opposed to Trump. Washington, D.C. voted overwhelmingly against Trump last November. He got just 4.1% of the vote in the nation's capital . He also lost the surrounding states of Maryland by 25 percentage points and Virginia by nearly 5 percentage points. It would be a longer trip for a critical mass of Trump supporters than for a critical mass of marchers.
It should also be noted that marchers took to the streets in other cities, nationwide, and in cities around the world.

770,"(CNN) The Women's March extended beyond the United States, as similar protests cropped up around the world over women's rights and other issues the marchers fear could be under threat from Donald Trump's presidency.
Although the focus of the day was the Women's March on Washington , many people attended the hundreds of ""sister marches"" that occurred around the US and the globe.
Women and men in cities including Sydney, Berlin, London, Paris, Nairobi and Cape Town, marched in solidarity with the marchers in Washington and in opposition to the values they think Trump represents.
Near and far
A crowd of people gathered near the US Embassy in Mexico City on Saturday, shutting down the street and holding signs.
Protesters in Mexico City demonstrated outside the US Embassy.
""Say it loud, say it clear, migrants are welcome here,"" they shouted.
Not all of the protesters were Mexican. Some Americans were there, too, in a show of solidarity.
One man told CNN, ""It's a little strange to have this kind of shame and lack of pride for what direction the United States is heading in.""
A ""pro-peace, pro-environment"" march also took place on Antarctica. Twitter user Linda Zunas posted pictures of people there taking part in the global event.

A separate group of about 30 Trump supporters held a rally in Sydney. The police restrained some of them, blocking them from entering the same area as the Trump protest group.
Protest organizers in New Zealand's capital, Wellington, said about 700 people turned out there for a women's march. Marches were also held in Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin.
Protesters also joined together to march in Nairobi, Kenya -- the African nation that was the native country of former President Barack Obama's father.
Marchers in Cape Town, South Africa, carried banners with slogans such as ""Climate change is a women's issue"" and ""So over mediocre men running things.""

Women's rights weren't the only issue on the agenda, with placards also bearing slogans to do with Brexit, nuclear weapons, workers' rights and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.
Speakers at Trafalgar Square told the crowds at least 100,000 people had turned out. London's Metropolitan Police do not provide crowd estimates, but aerial footage showed large numbers of people gathered in the square.

Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States as his wife, Melania, looks on during the inauguration ceremony in Washington on Friday, January 20. He used a family bible and one that belonged to Abraham Lincoln.
Trump's visit, his first official one since becoming President, was seen as part of a bid to mend fences after he strained relations with intelligence officials by repeatedly casting doubt on their assessment that Russia had carried out cyberattacks during the campaign. He also suggested that the intelligence community was leaking information about the investigation to the press, taking to Twitter to slam Brennan, a 25-year veteran of the agency.
The President sought to send a message of support to the intelligence community following the turbulent transition, telling the 300 employees in attendance, ""I am so behind you.""
""I am with you 1,000%,"" Trump said after receiving intelligence briefings from top agency officials.
""There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump,"" he said to applause, adding at the end of his remarks, ""I love you. I respect you. We're going to start winning again, and you're going to be leading the charge.""
Trump blamed the ""dishonest"" media for the perceived rift with the intelligence community.
Many observers had commented on the unmatched level of skepticism Trump had directed at the US intelligence apparatus, and other speakers Saturday addressed the relationship between presidents and the intelligence community.
""CIA's relationship with the president has been essential to our nation's strength and security,"" acting director Meroe Park said prior to introducing Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

""I can assure you this new President and our entire team recognizes and appreciates the sacrifices of all of the men and women of the intelligence community of the United States of America,"" Pence told the assembled group.
Trump echoed Pence's praise but drew the ire of Brennan as well as Democrats for using the platform to address political issues entirely unrelated to the CIA.
The backlash from a agency veteran like Brennan could undermine Trump's latest push to foster a strong relationship between the White House and the intelligence community.
The President did take a moment to acknowledge the memorial behind him, saying, ""The wall behind me is very, very special.""
Trump also spoke about his desire to ""eradicate radical Islamic terrorism ... off the face of the earth. This is evil.""
And he said about Iraq, ""We should have kept the oil. Maybe we'll have another chance.""
But Trump's off-the-cuff remarks veered into political territory at times, something not typically seen in addresses to intelligence professionals who pride themselves on being non-partisan and which drew a quick attack from Democrats.
The CIA audience was separated into two sections: a main area of all agency staff and a separate section directly in front of the stage that consisted of senior agency leadership, including agents. During Trump's address, the senior leadership stood the entire time. When Trump began drifting into political topics, the main crowd broke into cheers and applause at points. The senior leadership remained stoic, and did not applaud the political lines.
The president also repeatedly slammed the media, saying, ""I have a running war with the media"" and accusing news organizations of misrepresenting the size of the crowds at his inauguration speech on Friday.
He talked about the number of times he has been on the cover of Time magazine.
The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee issued a statement shortly after Trump's visit ripping the new president.
""While standing in front of the stars representing CIA personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country -- hallowed ground -- Trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice,"" Rep. Adam Schiff said, adding that Trump ""meandered through a variety of other topics unrelated to intelligence.""
""He will need to do more than use the agency memorial as a backdrop if he wants to earn the respect of the men and women who provide the best intelligence in the world,"" Schiff added.
The visit comes amid questions regarding the status of Trump's choice to run the agency, Rep. Mike Pompeo.
The CIA, currently being led by Park, is lacking a permanent chief as the Senate has delayed Pompeo's confirmation vote until Monday, with Democrats citing concerns about his positions on surveillance and other issues.
Pompeo, who was at the CIA with Trump, has encountered some controversy after he submitted responses to a Senate questionnaire where he said he would consider bringing back waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation measures under certain circumstances.

772,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump moved fast to mend his relationship with the CIA on just his second day in office, then ignited a feud with the media over the size of his inauguration crowd after mass nationwide protests erupted against his administration.
A day after he set the tone for his term by delivering a searing inaugural address laced with the populist themes that helped him win the election, Trump offered new evidence that he will be as disdainful of convention and protocol as President as he was in the campaign trail.
His broadside against the media, which he believes is unfairly representing the size of the crowd on Friday, and the sight of huge anti-Trump crowds in US cities and around the world also made another thing clear: the political acrimony that rattled the nation for the past 18 months is not going away.
Trump traveled to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, for a briefing from senior agency leaders and spoke to several hundred people in the spy agency's foyer, in front of a hallowed spot: the wall of honor where fallen operatives are remembered with stars.
""This is my first stop officially, there is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump, there is nobody,"" Trump said. ""I am so behind you and I know that maybe sometimes you haven't got the backing that you wanted.""
The gesture of the visit was an important moment for Trump, who raised doubts about his relationship with US intelligence agencies by initially casting doubt on their assessment that Russia intervened in the election by hacking Democratic email accounts. He had also spurred anxiety about his willingness to accept traditional presidential daily briefings on the gravest security threats facing the United States.
His comments were warmly received by CIA employees who came in on a Saturday to see their new president.
But Trump also departed from his topic, turning the event into a campaign-like appearance.
He complained about the media's treatment of him and accused television stations of not being truthful about the size of the crowd on Friday.
""I have a running war with the media, they are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth -- they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. The reason you are the number one stop is exactly the opposite,"" he said.
Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer appeared in the White House briefing room to warn the administration was going to hold the press ""accountable"" and argued that the Trump crowd was the largest inaugural crowd ever. He said any suggestion otherwise was ""shameful and wrong.""
Spicer then left the room after the statement without taking questions.
The White House appeared irked by cameras that showed large gaps in Trump's still large crowd on Friday compared to the one that showed historic numbers of spectators to see former President Barack Obama sworn in for his first term in 2009.
The chairman of Trump's inaugural committee, Tom Barrack, told CNN's Michael Smerconish that Trump was disappointed at what he saw as deceptive photos of the crowd that appeared on Twitter.

""I think it's appropriate because this president is just putting his fingerprint on what it's going to be like for him to be president. It's the same consistency of straight talk,"" Barrack said.
The spat was another reminder of Trump's deep sensitivity to criticism and to any suggestion that his popularity or election victory are not entirely legitimate.
Protests around the country
As Trump adjusted to the reality of power, those opposed to his presidency sent their own message, as a huge crowd gathered in Washington for a women's march and demonstrators also thronged cities including Chicago, Boston and Seattle. Protests also took place across the world, including in Sydney, Australia, London, Paris and Berlin.
The President's motorcade passed some of the protesters as he left the White House for the CIA. The protests were part of a grassroots organizing effort meant to demonstrate a show of force to the new administration that women's rights are human rights and to stress respect for racial, gender and political diversity that organizers say were threatened by Trump's campaign.
The plan had been to march on the White House but the larger-than-expected crowd in Washington clogged the planned route.
At another big rally in Boston, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Trump's presidency should serve as a rallying point for progressives.
""Yesterday, Donald Trump was sworn in as President. That sight is now burned into my eyes forever and I hope the same is true for you,"" Warren told the crowd.
""We will not forget, we don't want to forget. We will use that vision to make sure we fight harder, we fight tougher and we fight more passionately than ever.""
Clergy calls for unity at National Cathedral
Earlier, at Washington's National Cathedral, Trump took part in the traditional inauguration prayer service, as clergy from various faiths including Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Islam offer prayers for his administration and the nation.
In his opening prayer, the Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, the dean of Washington National Cathedral, appeared to be making a point about the need for unity after the bitter, divisive election campaign that made Trump president.
""Look with compassion on the whole human family; take away the arrogance and hatred which infect our hearts; break down the walls that separate us; unite us in bonds of love; and work through our struggle and confusion to accomplish your purposes on earth; that, in your good time, all nations and races may serve you in harmony around your heavenly throne through Jesus Christ our Lord,"" Hollerith said, reciting an excerpt from the Book of Common Prayer.
Trump, who was accused of discrimination against followers of Islam throughout the campaign, also sat quietly as a Muslim prayer echoed through the nave.
Imam Mohamed Magid, executive director of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, had been expected to deliver the Islamic call to prayer, but instead recited two verses from the Quran that contained clear political messages for the new president and his administration.
The President did not speak at the service.
World worries about speech
Trump was still buzzing on Saturday morning after the day of ceremony the day before.
""A fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech!"" Trump said in the first tweet from his personal Twitter account of his presidency.

Hours earlier, he swept into several inaugural balls with First Lady Melania Trump, and the couple danced to Frank Sinatra's ""My Way."" The President told the crowd at one event that even people who had not been nice to him said ""we did a really good job today. They hated to it but they did it. And I respect that. I respect that.""
The impact of Trump's inaugural address was reverberating around the world on Saturday. Foreign newspapers narrowed in on the nationalistic turn in US foreign policy.
""Trump offers fearful vision as he promises 'America First,'"" the Irish Times said in a front page splash. The Dawn newspaper in Pakistan highlighted Trump's inaugural vow to unite the world against ""radical Islamic terrorism.""
One of the world's most important leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, pledged to work with Trump to find ""compromises and solutions"" on the basis of mutual respect. Asked at a news conference about Trump's address and its America-first tone, she said: ""I believe firmly that it is best for all of us if we work together based on rules, common values and joint action in the international economic system, in the international trade system, and make our contributions to the military alliances.""
""And second, the trans-Atlantic relationship will not be less important in the coming years than it was in past years.""
Trump raised eyebrows in an interview while he was still President-elect in which he said he had similar levels of respect for Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is widely regarded as a US enemy in Washington.
First orders signed by Trump
Before spending his first night in the White House, Trump moved quickly to consolidate his power and to make an immediate break with the Obama administration. He signed an executive order that will begin the process of chipping away at the Affordable Care Act, the centerpiece of former President Barack Obama's domestic legacy.
The 45th President also signed documents validating the appointments of his newly confirmed cabinet members Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Other cabinet picks, including the incoming CIA director Mike Pompeo, are expected to receive votes from Monday, though partisan wrangling is still delaying many cabinet appointments.
White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus sent out a memo to all government agencies and departments calling for a freeze on new regulations.

Multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings told CNN that the synopsis included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump.
It also contained allegations of a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.
Trump rejected the claims. In a Twitter post Tuesday night, he said: ""FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!""

Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Vladimir Putin.
During a conference call on Wednesday, Peskov said the claims were false. ""No, the Kremlin does not have 'Kompromat' on Trump,"" he said in response to a question from CNN. ""The information does not correspond to reality and it is complete fiction.""
Peskov added: ""The fabrication of such lies in terms of the previous open part of the report, and this one which is a comparable lie, it's called pulp fiction in English.""

In the conference call, Peskov also denied that the Kremlin had compromising material on Hillary Clinton.
""The Kremlin and the Russian president tries to build relationships with our foreign partners in the interests of the Russian Federation and the Russian people and for the world in the interests of stability and security,"" he added.

In an unusual statement on Wednesday evening that highlighted tensions between spy chiefs and the incoming president, James Clapper, a key adviser to the US President on security and intelligence, rejected a suggestion by Trump that the agencies were responsible for the story going public.
Clapper said he told Trump that intelligence agencies made no judgment about the reliability of the allegations.
The claims were summarized in a two-page synopsis prepared for Trump and Barack Obama ahead of a national security briefing last week. Clapper's statement amounted to the first public confirmation from a US official of CNN's story that the synopsis existed and had been put together for the President, President-elect and eight Congressional leaders.
In his first news conference as President-elect on Wednesday, Trump railed on the US intelligence agencies , suggesting they were responsible for leaking the ""nonsense"" to the media. Any such move by the agencies would be a ""tremendous blot on their record,"" he said.
Before speaking with reporters, Trump went further in his attack. He said in a tweet: ""Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to 'leak' into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?""
On Thursday, Trump confirmed on Twitter he had received a call from Clapper: ""James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated. Made up, phony facts.Too bad!""

US director of national intelligence James Clapper
Clapper said in his statement that the synopsis was included in the briefing because ""part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.""
""The [intelligence community] has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions,"" Clapper noted.
It has not been established whether the agencies raised the material from the two-page synopsis directly with Trump at their recent meeting.
But the issue came up in Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo's confirmation hearing to head the CIA Thursday. Asked by Maine Independent Sen. Angus King if Pompeo would explore questions that arose in those reports, Pompeo stressed that the allegations were unsubstantiated and that he considered the ""leaks that occurred"" to be ""intensely serious.""

""I think it was Russia,"" Trump said. Putin ""should not be doing it. He won't be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I am leading it than when other people have led it.""
Trump, who has vowed to improve relations with Russia despite some Republican opposition, said he did not know if he would get along with Putin and noted it's possible he won't. But he could not resist a swipe at his defeated Democratic election rival, Hillary Clinton.
""Do you honestly believe Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me?"" he asked.
He added that Russia is not the only nation that hacks US targets and accused Democrats of not having sufficient cybersecurity programs.

'Witch hunt'
The news conference opened with the incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, slamming a ""political witch hunt"" following reports that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump.
Vice President-elect Mike Pence also criticized the media before introducing Trump, who kept up his criticism of US intelligence.
""I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies,"" Trump said.
He said any such move by the agencies would be a ""tremendous blot on their record.""
""A thing like that should never have been written, it should never have been had and it certainly should have never been released,"" Trump said.
The news conference follows exclusive reporting by CNN on Tuesday that classified documents presented last week to President Barack Obama and Trump included the allegations about Russia. The allegations were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and drew in part from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible.

The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Trump.
Conflicts of interest
The news conference, delayed from December, was scheduled for Trump to outline how he will address questions about possible conflicts-of-interest related to his vast business empire. Trump appeared beside a large pile of files he claimed were pertinent to the companies that are going to be placed in a trust to be run by his sons.
He reiterated that he doesn't plan to release his tax returns , saying they are under audit and don't include relevant information
After taking a handful of questions, Trump turned the event over to Sheri Dillon, an attorney who was on hand to discuss Trump's business interests. She said Trump planned to put in place a structure that will ""completely isolate him from the management of the company.""
""He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people that the decisions that he makes and the actions he takes as President are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests,"" she said.
Trump will place all his financial and business assets in a trust, Dillon said. The Trump Organization, meanwhile, will not enter into any new deals abroad and all domestic deals will be subject to a heavy vetting process. The firm will also appoint a new ethics officer, she said. The President-elect has also terminated a number of deals set to close shortly, a step that had cost him millions of dollars, she said.
Dillon argued that the decision had been made not to put all Trump's assets in a blind trust or to divest of all his assets because it would be impractical. She also said that Trump should not be forced to destroy the business that he had built up.
""President Trump can't unknow he owns Trump Tower,"" Dillon said, explaining why a blind trust would not be a workable solution to addressing conflicts of interest issues while he is President.
Dillon said Trump would take other actions to avoid the appearance of a conflict over the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits the president from accepting gifts from foreign governments unless authorized by Congress. She said it was unfair to apply the clause to Trump's ""arm's length"" transactions that he had nothing to do with or was not aware of.
""Just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires,"" she said. ""President-elect Trump has decided and we are announcing today that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels to the United States Treasury.""
Obamacare, border wall, Supreme Court
When he returned to the podium, Trump turned to policy, vowing to press ahead with a near simultaneous repeal and replacement of Obamacare at the same time, rejecting the approach of some Republicans on Capitol Hill who worry that rushing could create problems.
""It will be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously,"" he said, saying the two goals would be accomplished in the same week, day or even hour.
Trump reiterated that he will build a wall on the southern border and Mexico will pay for it, but defended his decision to ask Congress to fund it initially.
""We are going to build a wall,"" he said, adding that he didn't want to wait a year and a half to finish negotiating how Mexico would pay for it. ""Mexico, in some form ... will reimburse us.""
He added that the financing was more likely to take the form of a tax than a payment.
The President-elect also said he had been looking at the list of 20 potential Supreme Court nominees he had proposed to replace late Justice Antonin Scalia.
He said he would announce his decision ""within two weeks of the 20th, probably the second week.""",positive

790,"(CNN) President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday held his first news conference since winning the election, and CNN's Reality Check Team vetted his statements.
The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the event and analyzed key statements, rating them true, misleading or false.
Russia ties
Reality Check: Sean Spicer says Trump does not know Carter Page
By Kate Grise, CNN
Trump and his aides are denying new reports of the President-elect's possible ties to Russia. Carter Page is a former Trump adviser whose reportedly close ties to Russia have been called into question during the campaign. The FBI looked into allegations that, while in Russia last year, Page had meetings related to individuals under US sanctions.
""Carter Page is an individual whom the President-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign,"" Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, said Wednesday.
Trump, however, does at least know Page's name.
In an interview with The Washington Post editorial board in March, Trump named ""Carter Page, Ph.D.,"" as one of the people he was considering for his foreign policy team.
JUST WATCHED Spicer: Russia-Trump report is disgraceful Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Spicer: Russia-Trump report is disgraceful 01:55
On March 21, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed those people, including Page, to CNN.
Page founded an investment company, Global Energy Capital, and has worked as an investment banker in London and Moscow.
Page has denied the allegations that he met with sanctioned Russian officials, telling The Washington Post, ""All of these accusations are just complete garbage.""
He told The New York Times in March he had been sending policy memos to the campaign.
In a September appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said Page was no longer involved in the campaign and ""not authorized"" to speak with Russian officials on behalf of the Trump campaign.
It's unclear whether Trump knows Page personally, but it's evident Page was involved in the campaign as an early adviser. We rate Spicer's claim that Trump does not know Page misleading and his claim that Page was ""put on notice"" as true.
Reality Check: Trump has no deals in Russia
By Lisa Rose, CNN
Trump claimed he has no business ties with Russia, and punctuated his point by declaring that if he wanted to build in Russia, he could effortlessly find partners for a venture.
""I have no deals in Russia,"" Trump said. ""I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we've stayed away. ... We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to. I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict.""
It would be much easier to verify Trump's claim if his tax returns were public information. But because he hasn't turned over his IRS records, we'll have to look at prior comments he's made and news stories about his international business interests.
As recently as 2013, the President-elect was negotiating a deal with Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire, to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, according to a Washington Post investigation
Agalarov told the Post that although the plan to bring the Trump brand to Moscow didn't pan out, he hoped his family can partner with the Trumps at some point in the future.
While Trump claimed that it would be a piece of cake to build one of his signature monoliths in Moscow, he has been trying unsuccessfully to cut a deal in Russia for three decades.
In 1987, he visited the Soviet Union with his first wife, Ivana, and announced plans to develop a luxury hotel there. Nine years later, he filed paperwork to trademark the name Trump Tower in Russia and subsequently registered other business names such as Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Home, according to a CNN Money report
""Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment,"" Trump said during a 2007 court deposition. ""We will be in Moscow at some point.""
Trump's declaration that he and his company have stayed away from Russia is also dubious. He journeyed to Moscow in 2013 for the Miss Universe pageant, schmoozed with a clutch of oligarchs at a nightspot and ultimately collected $14 million from Russians who invested in the beauty contest, according to The Washington Post.
Trump's son, Donald Jr., made a half dozen business trips to Russia in 2007 and 2008 on behalf of the Trump Organization, according to the travel industry publication eTurboNews
""In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York,"" Trump Jr. said in the eTurboNews story. ""We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.""
Indeed. The President-elect earned nearly $100 million when he sold a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch named Dmitry Rybolovlev in 2008. During a press conference in July, Trump said that the sale of the mansion was his one and only link to Russia.
""That was a number of years ago,"" Trump said at the July press conference. He then conceded, ""I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, OK?""
It is true that there are no Trump-branded properties under construction in Moscow or elsewhere in the country but there is no way to verify the President-elect's claim that he is completely clear of business links to Russia without seeing his tax returns. His statement that Russia doesn't interest him is in contrast with decades of business trips and talk of grand plans for Moscow.
His remarks aren't outright false but we cannot give his claims the green light because he hasn't disclosed his tax returns. Our verdict: misleading.
Cybersecurity
Reality Check: Trump says US most vulnerable to cyberattack
By Jen Christensen, CNN
Trump said the US government ""is the worst"" when it comes to the nation's vulnerability in being hacked.
""If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries -- they put this in a category of an industry -- the United States is last in terms of protecting, let's say hacking defense,"" he said.
true, according to a 2016 US government cybersecurity That claim is, according to a 2016 US government cybersecurity report from SecurityScorecard.

When compared to 17 entities, including private retail and health care, the startup ranks the US government at the very bottom. The government is vulnerable to hacking, the report suggests, as it struggles with overall network security issues, software patching problems and malware infections. The problem, in part, stems from the large size of federal agencies; however, the report says, the upside is that those agencies may have larger budgets and larger security teams to deal with a hack attack.
Hacking has been a problem for the US government before. In July 2015, thieves stole data from Office of Personnel Management computer systems that included Social Security numbers of over 21.5 million people.
President Barack Obama addressed the issue at a news conference last month.
""Our economy is more digitized, it's more vulnerable, partly because we're a wealthier nation and we're more wired than other nations,"" Obama said.
CORRECTION: This Reality Check has been updated to clarify the number of entities ranked by SecurityScoreboard.
Conflicts of interest
Reality Check: 'No conflict of interest' for president, Trump says
By Eve Bower, CNN
Repeating a claim he has made several times in recent weeks, Trump appeared certain when he said, ""I have a no-conflict-of-interest provision as president.""
Specifically, he added, ""I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.""
The reality is much less clear-cut. Though there are a number of laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest for other public servants -- and do not apply to the President -- there are other constitutional and federal statutory provisions that may indeed be interpreted to restrict the business dealings of the President.
JUST WATCHED Trump: I will turn business over to my sons Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: I will turn business over to my sons 01:23
Nine such provisions were recently outlined in a memo from the Congressional Research Service. The provisions include both restrictions on gifts and other benefits the president may receive and financial disclosure requirements.
One key question concerns a part of the Constitution known as the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the president from receiving gifts from foreign governments. Because courts have not interpreted this provision in detail, it is unclear whether the various interests of the Trump Organization could become a conflict for the President-elect.
Because the truth is far more nuanced and uncertain than Trump portrays it to be, we rate this claim misleading.
Employment
Reality Check: Trump on 96 million out of the job market
By Patrick Gillespie and Tami Luhby, CNN
Trump cited a false statistic to cast the job market as weaker than it truly is.
""Ninety-six million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number. That's the real number,"" he said in defense of his plan to implement a border tax to keep American companies from moving jobs outside the US.
Here's the real deal on that stat: Some 93.8 million people are not in the labor force , but the vast majority of them don't want a job, according to the most recent quarterly data from the Atlanta Federal Reserve. Some 44 million are retired, 15.3 million are disabled, 13.3 million are taking care of a family member and another 13.2 million are in college or job training. They are listed as not wanting a job.
In addition, about 1.8 million are listed as marginally attached -- people who are not in the labor force who have looked for a job sometime in the past year -- and nearly 4.1 million are not marginally attached but want a job.
Some economists argue that the official unemployment figure -- 7.5 million in December -- understates the true state of the job market because it only counts people who are out of a job and have looked for work in the past four weeks.
A wider measure of unemployment includes people who've left the labor force but want a job, and part-timers who want full-time positions. Altogether, these three types of job-seekers total about 16 million, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
Because 16 million is a far cry from 96 million, we rate Trump's claim as false.
Tax returns
Reality Check: Americans 'don't care at all' about Trump's tax returns, he says
By Daniella Diaz and David Wright, CNN
Trump insisted that Americans ""don't care at all"" about his unreleased tax returns.

Trump was asked if he would release his tax returns to prove that he doesn't have business and financial ties to Russia that could be used as leverage against him.
""I'm not releasing the tax returns because, as you know, they're under audit,"" he said.
Trump's comments are directly contradicted by most major public polls on the issue. A CNN poll from October found that 73% of registered voters surveyed think Trump should release his tax returns for public review, including about half of Republicans at 49%.

Throughout the presidential campaign Trump pushed for the use of torture and enhanced interrogation techniques as a way to combat ISIS, though after winning in November, the President-elect has said that James Mattis, his choice to be the next secretary of defense, ""surprised"" him when he said he had not found waterboarding useful.

""No, no, hold on. You can't say you're not reporting it if it's on your website,"" Conway responded.
""You can't answer this question,"" Cooper said. ""What is inaccurate about our reporting?""
""Sure, I can,"" Conway said. ""Here's the answer -- if the four intelligence officials that gave the top secret briefing last week that some fools think they should leak to the media when it's a top secret intelligence briefing for a reason so that we're all protected, everybody, then why, according to your own report last night -- 'report' used as a loose word here -- why do they not tell the President-elect about it?

In an interview with Rolling Stone , the band's guitarist, David Evans, more commonly known as ""The Edge,"" said the group had nearly completed their newest album when ""the election (happened) and suddenly the world changed.""
""We just went, 'Hold on a second, we've got to give ourselves a moment to think about this record and about how it relates to what's going on in the world,'"" the U2 member said.

797,"Story highlights Pentagon officials are being asked to stay until key Trump appointees can be confirmed
The most senior official asked to stay on is Deputy Secretary Robert Work
Washington (CNN) Six senior Pentagon officials have been asked to stay on for the Trump administration's initial weeks to ensure the US military can react instantly in the case of a crisis, according to a current official.
Keeping these key personnel in place will ensure there are senior officials at all times authorized to carry out key functions in the event of an emergency, and that the military can operate smoothly immediately after the inauguration, two officials said.
A spokesman for the Trump transition declined to comment.
The Pentagon officials are being asked to stay until key Trump appointees can be confirmed by the Senate and take office. They could stay for up to three months, the first official said, but they also can leave at any time if they so choose.
The most senior official asked to stay on is Deputy Secretary Robert Work. He was asked specifically to temporarily extend his service by James Mattis, nominated to become secretary of defense. If Mattis for some reason is not sworn into office immediately upon Donald Trump's taking office, Work would be in place for any urgent development, even if it came in the minutes before Mattis is sworn in.

799,"Washington (CNN) The incoming Trump administration has told allies it is moving ahead with plans to relocate the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- even as those countries issue stark warnings of the potential impact and the Palestinians and Arab nations are escalating calls not to do it.
In Israel, where officials have lobbied countries for years to move their diplomatic missions to Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its capital, there is speculation a US announcement could be made as early as May 24 -- ""Jerusalem Day"" in Israel, a celebratory national holiday. That date comes just days before a waiver signed by President Barack Obama blocking the move expires.
While some diplomats said there are signs President-elect Donald Trump may pull back from his campaign pledge, Arab and European allies have warned the incoming administration that the move could unleash further violence, undermine the peace process, damage US standing in the Middle East, and endanger American personnel.
""It's very dangerous,"" said a European diplomat. ""Chances for the peace process are going very quickly -- it's now or never. Violence is always a concern and, at this point, it's probably easy for Palestinians to demonstrate their frustration.""
Jerusalem is already something of a tinderbox, with the most recent violence coming Sunday afternoon, when a Palestinian drove a truck into a crowd of Israeli soldiers, killing four.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has written to Trump to say an embassy move would have a calamitous impact on the chances for peace. And he warned in a recent speech that ""any statement or position that disrupts or changes the status of Jerusalem is a red line which we will not accept.""
Abbas has followed up with written pleas to the leaders of Russia, China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Arab League and others asking them to stop Trump.
Secretary of State John Kerry issued his own warning, telling CBS last week that if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, ""you'd have an explosion -- an absolute explosion in the region, not just in the West Bank and perhaps even in Israeli itself, but throughout the region.""
State Department officials, speaking anonymously so they can express themselves freely, said they fear the move will lead to security problems for US diplomatic missions and troops throughout the Middle East, create friction in US relationships with countries across the region, and cause even deeper rifts between Israelis and Palestinians.
The European diplomat said the US's long-standing role as an honest broker is also at stake.
""If the US changes its policy so dramatically, then it's very easy for others to dismiss their role and leadership in the peace process by saying, well, now the Americans are so closely aligned with Israel, it's hard for us to take them as brokers,"" the diplomat told CNN.
That diplomat's country, like the US under previous administrations, wants to wait to move its embassy to Jerusalem, which Palestinians also claim as their capital, until final peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
""We're always said we're fine with moving our embassy to Jerusalem when there's an agreement in place,"" the diplomat said.
This diplomat echoed others from Europe in saying that the Trump transition team has been very clear in talks that its priority is helping Israel ""in whatever terms Israel would like to be helped and if they prefer the embassy in Jerusalem, why not?""
US allies point out that if the embassy move takes place, it will matter where exactly it goes. West Jerusalem would be less problematic than if it's placed in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians could see as an annexation by Israel.
""If it's moved into East Jerusalem, the Palestinians would certainly view it as a provocative move,"" said another European diplomat.
The Trump team has offered no specifics on when or where the embassy would move, but Trump has said he'd like it to happen soon.
In a speech to the pro-Israel lobby group American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March, Trump said he wanted to ""move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem."" In a subsequent TV interview, he said the move would happen ""fairly quickly.""
The Trump team didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.
US officials told CNN one option would be to simply switch signs on the embassy in Tel Aviv and the smaller US consulate in Jerusalem -- but the embassy is so much larger, that would require some sort of immediate expansion of the consulate to accommodate the additional staff.
The US already owns part of a property in Western Jerusalem that could serve as a home to a future embassy there.
The Israeli Ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, has said an embassy move would be ""a strong message against the delegitimization of Israel and of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital."" Dermer, who has support on Capitol Hill, said that a move ""would be a great step forward to peace.""
The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act calls on the US to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the embassy there. But the law allows for the move to be waived if the President deems it harmful to US national security interests.
Since it passed, every US president -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- has signed the waiver every six months, even though Bush and Clinton had promised to move the embassy during their presidential campaigns.
Earlier this month, Obama renewed a presidential waiver delaying the move for another six months, citing ""national security interests.""
It is unclear whether the incoming administration or Congress could overturn that waiver before it expires on June 1. To pressure Trump to make good on his promise, a trio of Republican senators have introduced a bill that would strike language allowing presidents to use the waiver -- and would halve the budget for embassy security worldwide until a move takes place.
""Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state of Israel, and that's where America's embassy belongs,"" said one of the sponsors, Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio. ""It's time for Congress and the president-elect to eliminate the loophole that has allowed presidents in both parties to ignore U.S. law and delay our embassy's rightful relocation to Jerusalem for over two decades.""
With the six-month extension signed by Obama expiring on June 1, Israeli sources have suggested the May 24 Israeli holiday Jerusalem Day as a possible date for relocating the embassy. That national holiday commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem and the establishment of Israeli control over the Old City following the June 1967 Six Day War and typically is marked by ceremonies and memorial services.
But the extension could give the incoming administration time to rethink the consequences of its decision and find a face-saving way to back out. Diplomats suggested once the administration is in office for a few months, the realities of chaos in the Middle East and the need not to alienate US Arab allies may cause a newly minted President Trump to sing a different tune.
Last month, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman played down the crucial nature of immediately relocating the embassy.
""We've seen this promise (from US presidential candidates) in every election,"" Lieberman noted during remarks at the Saban Forum. ""It's very important but we have other issues.""",negative
800,"Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's transition has been floating the possibility of initially having the US ambassador to Israel work and live in the US consulate in Jerusalem, while the American Embassy remains in Tel Aviv.
Several diplomats, Israeli officials and sources close to the transition who are familiar with the idea said it could be seen as compromise that gives a nod to Israel on Jerusalem -- which Israel and the Palestinians both claim as their capital -- without the firestorm a formal relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv would almost certainly bring.
Diplomats said there have been signs Trump may pull back from his campaign pledge to relocate the US Embassy to Jerusalem amid warnings from Arab and European diplomats to the incoming administration that the move could unleash violence, undermine the peace process, damage US standing in the Middle East, and endanger American personnel.
Trump spoke about moving the US Embassy repeatedly during the campaign.
In a speech to the pro-Israel lobby group American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March, Trump said he wanted to ""move the American Embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem."" In a subsequent TV interview, he said the move would happen ""fairly quickly.""

802,"Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump told the New York Times he wants the Obamacare replacement to come simultaneously or soon after the repeal. But there are a few problems with that. To come up with a comprehensive replacement will take time. A long delay is not what Trump has in mind. The other alternative is to put some replacement elements in the repeal bill. It's a compromise, but there are only so many replacement items that can go into a repeal bill. In other words, the can gets kicked down the road.

Sessions also said that he does not support a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. During a break in the action, Durbin told CNN's Manu Raju that he was still troubled by Sessions, and that Sessions had not alleviated his concerns on immigration.
Two different hot button immigration cases move forward today:
There is a pretrial hearing in the case of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who's accused of killing Kate Steinle in 2015, which Trump often cited on the campaign trail. On Friday, a magistrate judge ruled that the Steinle family cannot sue the city of San Francisco over its sanctuary city policy. The Lopez-Sanchez criminal trial begins next month.

Republicans are worried about repealing the law without a replacement, which they don't have
Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's newest demand Tuesday that Republicans vote immediately to repeal and replace Obamacare -- maybe even as quickly as next week -- had Republican lawmakers struggling to understand the President-elect's intentions.
Given that lawmakers aren't anywhere near having a plan to revamp America's health care system, let alone voting on one, GOP lawmakers are wondering out loud: Should we take the President-elect literally?
""That quote was so true of Mr. Trump: 'The media took him literally but not seriously and his supporters took him seriously but not literally,'"" GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy told CNN. ""I think he speaks in concepts, and I accept his concept. We need a sense of urgency.""
Trump's New York Times interview came as House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans are trying to reassure rank-and-file Republicans who are nervous about repealing the Affordable Care Act too fast when there is not yet an alternative.
And the timeline Trump is advocating for is considered impossible -- a first procedural vote aimed at repealing Obamacare is slated for some time this week, but a final ""repeal"" legislation -- a budget reconciliation bill -- is not expected to be voted on for weeks or months.

But asked by Utah Sen. Mike Lee on Tuesday if the federal government would continue to look the other way while states enacted their own laws regarding marijuana, Sessions said he wouldn't commit to not enforcing existing federal law.
""It's not so much the attorney general's job to decide what laws to enforce. We should do our job and enforce laws as effectively as we're able,"" said Sessions, adding that Congress was entitled to change federal law if it so desired.
Still, the Marijuana Policy Project, which aims to allow states to determine their own marijuana laws, was encouraged by Sessions' comments.

(CNN) Classified documents presented last week to President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.
The allegations were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump.
The classified briefings last week were presented by four of the senior-most US intelligence chiefs -- Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers.
One reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took the extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing documents was to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress and other government officials in Washington, multiple sources tell CNN.
These senior intelligence officials also included the synopsis to demonstrate that Russia had compiled information potentially harmful to both political parties, but only released information damaging to Hillary Clinton and Democrats. This synopsis was not an official part of the report from the intelligence community case about Russian hacks, but some officials said it augmented the evidence that Moscow intended to harm Clinton's candidacy and help Trump's, several officials with knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.

816,"(CNN) Donald Trump is embarking on the most crucial week of his transition into the presidency -- and, as usual, he's at the epicenter of multiple controversies.
Several of the President-elect's most prominent Cabinet picks will appear on Capitol Hill this week for confirmation hearings that could be brutal. Trump will also hold his first formal news conference since the summer on Wednesday to address potential conflicts of interest that could surround his presidency.
President Barack Obama will move closer to exiting the stage when he delivers a farewell address Tuesday night from Chicago. Though the inauguration is less than two weeks away, the swirl of events means Trump's presidency effectively begins this week.
And as Washington moves closer to a historic transfer of power, Trump is in another pop culture feud -- this time with Meryl Streep after the actress offered a thinly veiled critique of the President-elect during Sunday night's Golden Globes.
The session with reporters in New York will be his first as President-elect and the first formal new conference he has held since July. As well as ethics, Trump's refusal to accept the assessment of US spy agencies that Russia was to blame for a cyber hacking operation against Democratic servers during the election will also dominate the event.
Confirmation hearings
On Capitol Hill, Trump's nominees are steeling for a flurry of confirmation hearings that will give Democrats an opportunity to pose pointed questions about ethics, Russia policy and other contentious issues surrounding the new administration.
Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick to become attorney general, is facing accusations of suppressing civil rights as an Alabama official. He appears before a panel of his colleagues Tuesday. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson, who has been named to serve as secretary of state, will face his Senate grilling Wednesday. That hearing will likely focus on his relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his positions on other key issues, such as global warming.
The President-elect appeared before reporters at Trump Tower Monday and several times dodged questions about the intelligence community's assessment that Russia tried to interfere with the election. But he predicted smooth sailing for all of his Cabinet nominees.
""Confirmation is going great,"" Trump said. ""I think they'll all pass. ...They're all at the highest level.""
The timing of Trump's news conference, which will saturate media coverage, could serve to overshadow the multiple hearings scheduled for Wednesday and mute the political impact of any missteps by Trump nominees.
Still, Trump's picks are taking no chances.

Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told CNN's ""New Day"" Monday the transition had conducted ""70 hours so far of mock hearings, 2,600 questions fielded by our nominees and our designates, and we've met with 87 US senators including 37 Democrats, and we'd like to meet with the remaining Democrats.""
The confirmation hearings will be shadowed by a growing controversy over claims by Democrats and the director of the federal Office of Government Ethics that the transition is rushing the confirmation process in a way that prevents a comprehensive screening of nominees.
But Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who serves on Trump's transition team, on Monday complained that bureaucratic foot dragging -- not the reluctance of Trump nominees to provide background information -- was to blame.
""Lots of times in D.C., we'll say maybe these guys need to realize they're going to have to work more than 40 hours in a week in order to get the job done and to meet a time schedule,"" Blackburn said on ""New Day.""
Incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer blamed Democrats for any delays.
""Everyone who has a hearing this week has their paperwork in. Full stop,"" Spicer told reporters.
Trump vs. Streep
The President-elect opened the week of political theatrics in typical fashion — with a Twitter storm taking on Streep. Trump tweeted that the Hollywood star was a ""Hillary flunky who lost big"" and denied her accusation, featured prominently in the presidential campaign and supported by video evidence, that he ridiculed a disabled New York Times reporter.
""I never 'mocked' a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him ... 'groveling' when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!"" Trump wrote in consecutive tweets.
The exchange between Streep and Trump seemed to underscore the country's deepening culture wars. Trump has shown no desire to rein in his social media tirades during the transition, and has characteristically hit back every time he perceives a slight is delivered against him. His habit could revolutionize the way the President communicates with the American people.

Democrats, however, emboldened by a visit from Obama to Capitol Hill last week, appear unlikely to offer the GOP any help on the issue. They're betting that Trump will take the blame if the system set up by the Affordable Care Act spins into meltdown.
There were also reminders early on Monday of the restive world that Trump is inheriting, that in some cases appears to be reacting to his vow to ditch the conventions that have underpinned US foreign policy for decades.

""Back when Trump was spinning birther conspiracy theories, which were lapped up by gullible Republicans, one person who talked to Kushner says he offered assurances that his father-in-law didn't really believe that stuff,"" the report says.
Kushner, a key adviser to Trump, is expected to play an influential role in the new administration and is reportedly taking steps toward preventing conflicts of interest from his own real estate business dealings. It's unclear whether he and wife Ivanka Trump will hold official positions, but Trump's team is confident that, at a minimum, the President-elect's daughter and son-in-law can act as informal advisers once he's in the White House.
One sign they're serious: the Trump-Kushner family recently settled on a home in Washington, DC. The President-elect is expected to address his businesses and his family's participation in his presidency in a news conference this week.

824,"Washingotn (CNN) US Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy wants to set the record straight about President-elect Donald Trump's private security team and whether it's causing conflict with his agents.
In an exclusive interview with CNN -- his first since Trump's election -- Clancy also offered a wide-ranging look at the unique logistical challenges of providing security for the President-elect's large family and securing his New York residence.
Most of all, however, he wanted to push back against suggestions that there were conflicts between the Secret Service and the private security team that's protected Trump for years. Politico reported last month that Trump's private team ""bristled"" at the Secret Service's desire to take the lead in protecting Trump and in some cases, they had gotten in the way of the agency's protocols.
""There is no friction at all"" with Trump's private team, insisted Clancy, who said his agency has ""sole responsibility"" for protecting the President and the first family. He added that there is no overlap between the private team and his agency.
""They are not in our meetings,"" Clancy said. ""They are not armed. They are more of a staff function than a security function. We don't interact with them.""
He explained that while Trump's private team is there to ensure public events run smoothly and there are no disruptions from the crowd, Secret Service agents are the only ones protecting the President-elect.
Although protesters have been a feature of many Trump campaign stops and some have pledged to protest the inauguration, Clancy said that unless a protester is a direct physical threat to the President, the Secret Service will not intervene.
""We want to make sure everyone has their First Amendment rights,"" he said, adding that if a protester is removed, that is a decision made by event staff.
Trump has named the head of his private security team, retired NYPD officer Keith Schiller, as his director of Oval Office operations and deputy assistant to the President. Clancy said Schiller serves as a ""conduit for information"" between the agents and the President-elect and helps inform the Secret Service about any changes to Trump's itinerary.
""He has a larger family. He's got five children, grandchildren, so that will require more assets, more personnel,"" Clancy said.
He noted that Trump's children are ""young adults, so they're very active, they travel."" But Trump's Fifth Avenue residence in New York City, Trump Tower -- where future First Lady Melania Trump plans to reside through next spring with the couple's youngest son -- presents a different challenge.
It's not unusual for a first lady to be in a different location than the President, Clancy said, but he acknowledged the new Trump arrangement represents a ""longer period of time"" than usual -- even though his agency would never advise the first family to change their preferred living arrangements.
""There are enough inconveniences when you take on this role as President and first lady,"" Clancy said. ""We don't want to add to that.""
Trump Tower
The midtown Manhattan building sits on one of the busiest streets in the country. Clancy said the goal is to provide robust security while simultaneously allowing local businesses and residents to continue using the building.
""We are bringing in more resources"" to handle the situation, he said, adding that the Secret Service is working to establish a command post inside Trump Tower that would be ""pretty close to an entire floor.""
According to Jared Horowitz, who works for the company responsible for available commercial space at Trump Tower, the floors available to rent -- with the average floor space running between 13,500 to 15,500 square feet -- cost about $1.5 million a year. Asked about the high price tag, Clancy said they were required by law ""to pay for the property that we need,"" adding that the space was ""critical to the protection of the President, so it's something that needs to be done.""
""It's actually no different than what we've done with other presidents,"" Clancy continued. ""We rented some property in Chicago when President Obama first became president for his trips when he was going out to Chicago. So, this is typically what we do.""
Regarding the government's negotiations with their new landlord, the Trump Organization, Clancy said, ""They're very fair with us. They understand the responsibilities we have and they've been very accommodating.""
Protecting the President
Clancy, a 27-year veteran of the Secret Service who ran the presidential protection division during the first years of Barack Obama's presidency, noted there are more similarities than differences among the presidents they protect.
""I don't think any of them sleep very well,"" he said. ""They're also very schedule-oriented. They all run on tight schedules,"" adding that, ""They're all involved in athletics. Some enjoy golf, some enjoy running, some biking.""
In the past year and a half that the Secret Service has been working with Trump, Clancy said he has met with him a couple of times, describing him as ""very gracious and very appreciative"" of the Secret Service.
Asked how Trump was adjusting to motorcades and having round-the-clock teams of armed agents guarding him, Clancy said ""it's unusual for anyone to get used to it, but he has been terrific.""
Threats in the age of Twitter
Two newer areas the Secret Service is focused on are social media and cyberthreats, an area of particular concern given Trump's frequent use of Twitter and mounting concerns regarding US cybersecurity.
The director said the Secret Service now has a specific division focused on potential social media threats. He also said they are deploying the same experts that provide cyber security for the US financial system in order to ensure that facilities visited by the president are defended from cyber-attacks.
""Everything keeps me up night,"" he said of the array of threats.
But, he added, ""that's our business.""",positive

(CNN) Now that he's about to assume office, the real costs of the ""great, great"" wall Donald Trump promised to build during his campaign are beginning to settle in -- and threaten to divide the President-elect and thrifty Republicans on Capitol Hill.
But Trump's grand vision of a impenetrable barrier from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico -- a physical monument to his hardline immigration policy -- hasn't dimmed, although some of the specifics have changed.
He is asking congressional Republicans, not Mexico, to fund the plan with taxpayer money through the appropriation process.

""While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,"" Trump said in a statement after the meeting.

A senior transition official described the meeting between Trump and intelligence community officials as ""cordial,"" not contentious. Trump asked questions and made clear his admiration for intelligence community employees, the official added.
Based on the presentation Friday, which included new information, the official insisted that it's the transition's view that the hacking was intended to harm Hillary Clinton more than to help Trump. This official pointed to what they were told at the meeting, that the cyberactivity began in late 2015 and early 2016, before it was clear Trump would be the nominee. So, the official asked, how could the hacking be a pro-Trump operation if it began so early on.
""This was more an effort to discredit her than anything else,"" the official said.
The official would not weigh in on the intelligence community's main conclusion that Putin directed the hacking operation, saying it was based on classified information.
In a statement Friday accompanying the release of a declassified report on Russian involvement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that the ""intelligence community did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.""
It added that the Department of Homeland Security concluded that ""the types of systems the Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying.""
Democrats seethe
Trump's public refusal to acknowledge the intelligence community's conclusions drew sharp responses from Democratic lawmakers Friday. And with the release of the report, Democrats said they will renew their push for a bipartisan independent commission to investigate Russia's actions. To date, Republicans have insisted on keeping investigations within existing committees that they control.
""There must be a bipartisan, independent, outside commission to understand how Russia hacked into our democratic institutions, and to ensure it never happens again,"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat. ""Vladimir Putin's assault on American democracy was political thuggery in support of Donald Trump, and there must be consequences.""
Pelosi, who had earlier called the report's conclusions ""stunning,"" said she is co-sponsoring House legislation that was re-introduced Friday and calls for a bipartisan, independent commission. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, formerly a longstanding member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she and other senators will soon introduce a similar bill.
""This issue must not be politicized -- all Americans should be outraged at Russia's actions, and we must hold them accountable,"" she said.
Senate Minority Leader and New York Democrat Charles Schumer said, ""That any foreign power could influence an American election should send shivers down the spines of both political parties, regardless of which party benefited this time around ... We need to confront this interference head on, in an aggressive and bipartisan manner. If we don't, it'll be open season for any foreign power who wants to cause trouble in our elections.""
Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, dismissed Trump's argument out of hand.
""The President-Elect's statement that the Russian hacking had 'absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election' is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,"" Schiff said in a statement.
He added that while there was no tampering with vote tallying, ""it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to Secretary Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyberoperations had no effect on the campaigns.""
Schiff said the Putin-directed effort was ""hugely beneficial to the President-Elect and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended,"" and called on Trump to act ""appropriately in the face of this clear-cut, Russian malicious activity against America. That starts by accepting the facts. The President-Elect must not obfuscate or distract, but deal honestly with the truth of what happened.""
One Republican, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, took the opportunity to pressure Trump to get tougher on Moscow.
""I take his statement as an encouraging sign that he wants to push back against those who engaged in cyberattacks against our country's national security, economic and political interests,"" Graham said in a statement.
""More specifically, when it comes to Russia, I look forward to working with President-elect Trump to achieve those goals,"" added Graham, who is pushing to sanction Russia for its activities in cyberspace, Syria and against US allies in Europe. ""Now is the time to throw rocks, not pebbles, and a good place for us to start would be to institute additional punishments on Russia for their cyber interference in the 2016 elections.""
Russia had 'clear preference' for Trump
Shortly after Trump's statement, the intelligence community released a declassified version of the report that found Putin had ordered a campaign to influence the 2016 election with the goal of denigrating Clinton, boosting Trump and undermining public faith in the democratic process.
""We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,"" the intelligence report said.
The Russian efforts blended covert activity, including cyber operations, with overt efforts, including paying social media ""trolls."" The operation was just ""the most recent expression of Moscow's longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal order,"" the report said.
The report shared conclusions reached in the classified version, but didn't include information that could give away sources and collection methods.

Despite the fact that the intelligence community has never argued that the hacks swayed the outcome of the election, Trump and other Republicans have continued to emphasize that point. Intelligence leaders have been careful to stress that voting systems weren't tampered with, but they told a Senate hearing Thursday that it was impossible to assess how the hacking may have affected voters' attitudes. After lawmakers and intelligence officials expressed concern at that hearing about Trump's putdowns of the intelligence community, he praised them in his statement Friday.
""I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation,"" Trump said.
Former CIA chief and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called those comments a step in the right direction for Trump.
""I pray that we get beyond this bickering and tweeting with regards to the intelligence community,"" he said on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""And his statement today at least was a step in the right direction. He talked about having a constructive meeting, he indicated he has tremendous respect for the men and women in our intelligence community ... so I hope that he's moving in the right direction.""
President Barack Obama, who last month asked the intelligence community to provide the comprehensive report on Russia's cyberactivities last month, was briefed Thursday.
Trump's muted reaction to the officials' briefing will not subdue questions about his stance on Russia. Trump has repeatedly rejected the October assessment of all 17 US intelligence agencies that Russia stole and shared emails from Democratic organizations and individuals and probed voting systems in several states.
Throughout the campaign, Trump emphasized his interest in improving relations with Moscow and his admiration for Putin, who he has praised as a strong leader who is ""very smart."" That praise has puzzled observers, who point to Russia's annexation of Crimea, its alliance with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its attempts to destabilize US allies in Europe, particularly in the Baltic states, its harassment of US diplomats, and its systematic expulsion of American Non-Governmental Organizations in Russia.
Trump has derided intelligence agencies for weeks, setting off the word ""intelligence"" in quotation marks to indicate his skepticism and suggesting their conclusions were politically motivated. That idea is anathema to officers who pride themselves on providing ""unvarnished"" and ""untainted"" information to policy makers, Clapper said.
California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell and Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings re-introduced a bill Friday to establish a bipartisan, 12-member commission that has the support of 170 House lawmakers. The legislation calls for the commission to examine Russia's hacking as well as cyber intrusions by other nations and produce a report with recommendations to the President within 18 months.
Over 50,000 Americans have signed a petition released Friday urging Congress to create an independent commission, telling lawmakers that ""regardless of whether you voted for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, or anyone else, Russia's attacks on our election are an attempt to degrade our democracy.""

830,"CNN correspondents and commentators experienced the 2016 presidential election in unique and interesting ways. This recollection and others were produced in conjunction with CNN's election project, ""A Race Like No Other: The Unprecedented Election of 2016.""
(CNN) Never have I had a more surreal experience than covering a presidential candidate who I personally knew. And who happened to be Donald Trump.
I met Trump a number of times in the decade before he announced he would run for president. We'd become acquainted through television and various political events. He once asked that I introduce him when he was giving a speech, which I did. I met and had been on air with his son, Don Jr. When I happened to move into a Trump building in New York, I received a cutting board with my initials engraved in it from the Trump Organization.
We certainly weren't ""close,"" but definitely familiar. Which is why his team undoubtedly trusted me with the embargoed draft of his campaign announcement before he delivered it at Trump Tower. When he didn't actually read from that draft, I knew covering Trump would be ... challenging.
Early on it was clear to me the campaign wasn't going anywhere good. Talk of Mexican rapists, Eisenhower-era immigration policies, Muslim bans and rank sexism was what we'd tried to push out of the party after Mitt Romney's loss in 2012. We wanted to focus instead on the issues that made conservative policies appealing to broad swaths of people -- limited government, fiscal responsibility and a strong national defense.
So I was harsh -- brutal, at times -- swatting at his proposals, his outbursts, his surrogates, in print and on television. The way I saw it, disavowing the man my party seemed most enamored of, who would eventually become its nominee, and whom I knew personally, was awkward. But it was a necessary part of a daily battle for the soul of the conservative movement.

Two decades later, that lifesaver is playing his most prominent role yet. Barrack is overseeing Trump's inauguration in two weeks -- a project that has so far raised close to $90 million. Once the festivities are over, Barrack, 69, is poised to wield enormous influence in Trump's Washington as the person perhaps closest to the new president outside of his immediate family.
Over the next four years, a dozen people close to Barrack and Trump observed in interviews, Barrack is almost certain to reprise the middleman job he played during that West Side crisis -- as an inimitable powerbroker to the set of elites desperate to control him, and as a calming guardrail to the man who doesn't want to be controlled.
""Most of the people around him are all vying for his attention, his acknowledgment or his approval,"" Barrack said during an interview this week at Washington's new Trump International Hotel, where he is recognized by name by staff and well-wishers who interrupt him with meeting or favor requests for Trump's team.
That's his life these days: ""It's like being the concierge or the sommelier of choice.""
Unlikely surrogate
With the 6-foot-2 build of a shooting guard and the aphorisms of an inspirational speaker, Barrack admits he is not the likeliest Trump surrogate. With his refined, almost patrician image and the sensibilities of a Renaissance Man, the Arabic-speaking Barrack cuts a striking visage in the populist orbit that is ushering Trump to the White House.
But friends and rivals alike note that Barrack, with a net worth of $1 billion and a network that includes Qatari princes and France's Nicolas Sarkozy, offers something that so few of the people battling for Trump's ear today can match: trust that, as his financial peer, he looks out for no one but Trump.
It is a friendship forged in both the tumble of deals gone awry and the triumph of a shocking political upset. At every turn over the last two years, when Trump found himself against the world, Barrack on the other end of the line, dispensing frank truths while pleading to the offended that Trump meant no harm.
When scores of women emerged to allege sexual misconduct by Trump this past October, Barrack asked him to write down what exactly made him upset in private, and at the same time promised to vouch for his integrity in public. When in need of a way to soften his image with Mexico, Barrack encouraged Trump to take a last-minute secret trip to Mexico and show he could blunt his rhetoric on the world stage. And when Muslim monarchs rang alarm bells at a policy meant to forbid their 1.6 billion adherents from immigrating to the US, Barrack urged Trump to retool his abrasive posture -- while back-channeling soothing words to his own Rolodex.
By now, word of his influence has gotten around: Barrack serves as the connective fiber between his elite circles and the insular, Breitbart-infused Trump Tower. He brokered a meeting on climate change between Leonardo DiCaprio and the President-elect, and fields phone calls and emails from worried investors and ambassadors seeking reassurances from the next leader of the free world: ""Tell me we're going to be OK,"" they implore Barrack.
In a city full of lobbyists eager to play connector, it is the cabal of longtime Trump associates -- from Barrack to Roger Stone to Carl Icahn -- who are the new set of Washington greasers.
""The way it used to be, you go to a lobbyist, you pay the lobbyist a bunch of money, and he takes care of politics,"" said Gary Winnick, a close friend to Trump and Barrack who now spends much of his time making similar introductions.
But Trump campaigned vigorously against the lobbyist culture, and would care for something different, Winnick stressed.
""Tom was there when Donald was getting his a-- kicked in the 80s and 90s,"" he said. ""I don't think Donald has ever forgotten that.""
Born to immigrants
Born to immigrants who owned a tiny Lebanese grocery store, Barrack made his fortune in distressed assets, or what he saw as low-risk, high-reward properties desperate for rehabilitation. He and Trump argued, bartered and caroused together. Barrack now fondly remembers deals where Trump ""took me to the cleaners.""

And over time, the two indulged in elements of celebritydom: Trump as a fixture of the New York socialite scene; Barrack as an investor in Hollywood film companies and as a Mr. Fix It for distressed celebrities -- he is credited with saving Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch, and counts Rob Lowe as one of his best friends.
But it was in the 1990s when Trump grew attached to Barrack, born just a year after him and with the emotional composure that even Trump's allies say he lacks. Over the years, the two would share tales of their marital struggles, friends say, and bond over their moments as classic tough guys.
""They used to like to arm wrestle together,"" cracked Doug Manchester, a longtime Barrack pal. ""Not literally -- but maybe.""
The stories are ripped from movies: When two intimidating men barreled down Park Avenue one spring day after pick-pocketing a woman's purse, Rogers recalls, Barrack delivered a rugby tackle he learned in college and held one of them down for 20 minutes. Soon after, the other culprit's half-dozen friends socked him in the nose, spilling blood over his cream-colored suit.
""He's a man. He falls off horses going full speed, surfs waves. He's a stud,"" Laird Hamilton, a well-known professional surfer in Hawaii who rides aggressive waves with Barrack, said from his boat in Hanalei Bay. ""We like the feeling of challenging the impossible.""
Barrack, many of his associates recounted, offers an eclectic spin on the quintessential ""guy's guy."" He jeers friends when they appear out of shape at the gym, but has chosen competitive polo -- not Trump's golf game -- as his sport of choice. He drinks alcohol, but grows his own wine at a 1,300-acre ranch he built near Santa Barbara, California, and spends his summers lavishly near Cannes in the French Riviera.
His aggression doesn't extend to politics. A moderate Republican, Barrack has little interest in partisan combat and said he was occasionally dispirited by Trump's most corrosive rhetoric.
His extemporaneous prime-time speech at last summer's Republican National Convention -- most memorable for awkwardly deeming his speech preceding that of Trump's daughter to be the ""anchovy on Ivanka's caesar salad"" -- featured another surprising moment. He told the crowd of Republican activists, who had encouraged speakers all week to ""lock her up,"" that he had nothing negative whatsoever to say about Hillary Clinton.
""Donald used Tom at the beginning to bounce ideas off of him. Tom didn't get into it for political reasons,"" said Nick Ribis, a top Trump casino executive who later worked for Barrack. Ribis marvels at how the two personalities co-existed. ""Egos tend to get in the way — jealousy and egos. It wasn't that way with Donald and Tom.""
Despite his total lack of political experience, Barrack volunteered to hold Trump's first major fundraiser at his home, raising $7 million in a show of force that attendees at the head table describe as an emotional moment for the old friends. Some associates recall having never once before heard Barrack discuss politics before that evening.
The soft-spoken Barrack describes the campaign as his own personal metamorphosis.
""This is where I come from. That's me,"" Barrack, now the head of a $60 billion company, Colony Capital, said he thought as he soaked in Trump crowds across the country. ""This is more me than the me now.""
Fundraising stumbles
Barrack's adventure in cash-collecting was not without stumbles. Trump fundraisers say he dropped off the map after that event and for most of the campaign. And despite broadcasting widely that a super PAC he helped organize, Rebuilding America Now, had made a splash and took in $32 million this summer, that money was slow to materialize -- if it did at all. Barrack, over-extended and overwhelmed by looming campaign finance restrictions on what he'd be able to legally discuss with Trump, suddenly distanced himself from the group, which never lived up to its hype as Barrack watched Trump be massively outspent on television for nearly the entire race.
Part of the trouble was that despite Barrack's place in the firmament of high society, sources said, he offered none of traditional fundraising relationships that Trump desperately needed. He knew nothing of the network assembled by Charles and David Koch, and though he scored a meeting with Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, he was unable to secure his confidence and a donation to his super PAC.
The inauguration grants him something of a path to fundraising redemption. This time, Barrack won a $5 million check from the Adelsons, according to a person familiar with the donation. Barrack now talks to Trump every day about the ceremony, and it's that confidence of the President-elect that inauguration planners say gives him wide latitude over every last detail of the day, which will emphasize the military and ""inclusiveness"" rather than the traditional focus on celebrities.
And for all Trump's fundraising struggles during the campaign, the inauguration is surprisingly well funded. The $90 million figure revealed to CNN came in large part from what Barrack called ""a lot of low-hanging fruit"" from Trump gadflies eager to make amends for their past stinginess.
""Many of the establishment Republicans who were not involved in Trump Victory have now unified,"" said Elliott Broidy, one of the Trump campaign's most elite fundraisers and a vice chair of the Inaugural Committee. ""That can be credited to Tom doing a phenomenal job articulating our President-elect's vision.""
He expects to keep at it well after the ceremony concludes. While Barrack has leaned into his role as Trump's filter to the outside world, he still dreams of an even bigger role. Perpetually sleepless and rarely in the same city for multiple nights, Barrack envisions himself making frequent trips to the Middle East on behalf of the administration's interests. He is already calling upon his far-flung network to help place US ambassadors in capitals overseas.
But as Trump loyalists know, there is always the looming danger of overplaying your hand in Trump World. It's a lesson that Washington is soon to learn.
""There's nobody bigger in Donald's eyes than Donald -- and don't try to compete with that,"" warns Winnick. ""I'm not sure everybody else knows that, but Tom does.""",negative
832,"Story highlights Republicans are unanimous in their desire to ""repeal and replace,"" but not unanimous on the details
The GOP can't lose more than two votes of its senators to pass the bill
Washington (CNN) Republicans are unanimous in their desire to ""repeal and replace"" President Barack Obama's signature health care law -- but they are already flirting with not having the 50 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate.
Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate, meaning they can only afford to lose three members of their caucus before they cannot pass legislation without Democratic votes. (In the case of a 50-50 tie, the vice president casts the tie breaker -- presumably in favor of the GOP side.)
While only one Republican -- Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul -- has thus far signaled he might vote no on the Obamacare repeal mechanism currently moving through the Senate, potential flashpoints have already emerged that could jeopardize further votes.
House Speaker Paul Ryan's support of using the Obamacare repeal measure to strip federal funding for Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides abortions as part of its broader reproductive health care services to men and women, could cost the GOP two key votes.
That measure would likely pass in the House, but two pro-abortion rights GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, won't commit to approving the bill with the Planned Parenthood provision in it.

He wasn't the only Mexican to tweet at Trump on Friday
Washington (CNN) Former Mexican President Vicente Fox is back to trolling Donald Trump on Twitter, particularly as the US President-elect has waffled on his pledge to have Mexico pay for a border wall and amid questions about Russian interference in the election.

Fox's jab at Trump comes after the US intelligence community concluded in a declassified report released that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an ""influence campaign"" aimed at hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Trump.
In addition to that, Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton by 2.9 million votes -- not more than 3 million votes, as Fox said in his tweet -- which has been something of a touchy subject for Trump, who has cited his Electoral College lead to highlight his win.

834,"CNN correspondents and commentators experienced the 2016 presidential election in unique and interesting ways. This recollection and others were produced in conjunction with CNN's election project, ""A Race Like No Other: The Unprecedented Election of 2016.""
(CNN) Here's a confession: I was present at the creation. Donald Trump rode down his golden escalator to announce his candidacy about 11 a.m., June 16, 2015. After 45 minutes of rambling divisiveness that included some of his early hits -- introducing ""Make America Great Again,"" boasting about his wealth and calling Mexicans ""rapists"" -- I was slack-jawed and ready to do post-game commentary on CNN.
My on-air reaction to the man who would be the GOP nominee? ""This is a reality TV show star trying to run to pump up his profile even more because he is drunk on pure ego."" At the end of this surreal and unprecedented election, this still sounds about right to me.
The media came under a lot of criticism for underestimating Trump and dismissing his supporters. I always believed he could do well in the primaries. After all, the GOP had been systematically excommunicating its center-right, leaving it susceptible to a hostile takeover from conservative populists who for decades had been pained by economic and cultural change. They weren't in the mood for a moderate candidate wielding thoughtful policies that could unite the nation. They were ready to fall in love with a defiantly un-PC celebrity strongman.
We'd seen Trump's political stripes when he was cheerleading the birther conspiracy theory four years earlier. There was little reason to think that he'd suddenly discover a political conscience or deep policy chops. But I mistakenly thought that a master marketer who'd been obsessed with cultivating the press for decades would try to win over the media. Instead, Trump decided to declare war on journalists.
The Daily Beast got an early taste of the Trump team's tactics the month after his announcement, when reporter Tim Mak called Michael Cohen, special counsel to the Trump Organization, to ask about a long-forgotten deposition from Trump's first divorce. In it, Trump's first wife, Ivana, accused him of making her feel ""violated"" during sex at the end of their marriage and used the word ""rape"" to describe one incident in 1989, according to ""Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,"" by Harry Hurt III. She later retracted the allegation and, during the campaign, said the story was ""totally without merit.""

837,"(CNN) The feud between Donald Trump and the US intelligence community will play out behind closed doors Friday when the President-elect is given a briefing on allegations of election-related hacking by Russia.
The meeting comes at the end of a week in which Trump's public skepticism over evidence Russia interfered in the US political process has pitted him against the country's top spy chiefs and high profile lawmakers in both parties.
Trump will sit down with James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, as well as several other leading agency heads, the day after a Senate Armed Services Committee on cyberthreats Thursday.
With just two weeks until his inauguration, there are concerns over Trump's seeming refusal to give more credence to the views of leading US intelligence agencies than to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin and WikiLeaks fugitive Julian Assange.
The drama has even caused outgoing Vice President Joe Biden to tell the President-elect he should ""grow up"".

On Thursday, Clapper laid bare both his concerns and those of his colleagues at the President-elect's views of the US intelligence community.
Speaking at a hearing on global cyberthreats that focused almost exclusively on Moscow's alleged hacking during the presidential elections, he said there was a difference between ""skepticism and disparagement.""
""I do think public trust and confidence in the intelligence community is crucial both in the US and in other countries that rely on US intelligence,"" he said.
""I've received many expressions of concern from foreign counterparts about the disparagement of the US Intelligence Community, or I should say, what has been interpreted as disparagement of the US intelligence community.""
As officials try to make sense of Trump's skepticism, one theory is that the President-elect is concerned that his victory is being undermined by allegations that Russia tried to affect the 2016 vote.
Republican John McCain, the committee chairman, emphasized the Russian role and delivered an implicit rebuke to Trump, who has urged people to ""move on"" from the issue of Moscow-directed hacking.
""Every American should be alarmed by Russia's attacks on our nation,"" he said. ""There's no escaping the fact that this committee meets today ... in the aftermath of an unprecedented attack on our democracy.""
During the hearing -- a rare show of bipartisan unity in Washington -- Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Trump's ""demeaning and dismissive"" comments about intelligence officers were unacceptable, and praised their service.
Breakthrough?
On Thursday, US intelligence identified the go-betweens the Russians used to provide stolen emails to WikiLeaks, according to US officials familiar with the classified intelligence report that was presented to President Obama.
The new information has given agencies increased confidence that Russia carried out the hack and did so, in part, to help Trump win.
Included in that new information were intercepted conversations of Russian officials expressing happiness at Trump's win. Another official described some of the messages as congratulatory.
Officials said this was just one of multiple indicators to give them high confidence of both Russian involvement and Russian intentions. Officials reiterated that there is no single intercepted communication that qualifies as a ""smoking gun"" on Russia's intention to benefit Trump's candidacy or to claim credit for doing so.

Trump has been prolific on Twitter in recent weeks , taking on those who have accused him of dismissing the findings of the nation's intelligence agencies.
Last week, Trump suggested that intelligence officials postponed an ""'intelligence' briefing on so-called 'Russian hacking'"" that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time ""to build a case."" He called the alleged delay ""very strange.""
Trump has also faced criticism for appearing to back claims made by WikiLeaks founder Assange, who said Russia wasn't the source of stolen documents from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) that his group distributed.
Trump rejected those accusations, tweeting: ""The dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against ""Intelligence"" when in fact I am a big fan!""
Trump also questioned claims by the Democratic Party that their computer servers had been hacked, adding: ""How and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?""

After Obama placed a series of sanctions on Russia, Trump issued a statement calling for the country to ""move on to bigger and better things"" and then tweeted praise for Vladimir Putin for not retaliating against the sanctions.

Washington (CNN) To drink at Donald Trump's DC hotel lobby bar, The Benjamin, having the President-elect's wallet would be helpful.
The bar at Trump International Hotel has recently increased its signature cocktail prices -- a lot. The least expensive drink, the bourbon-based ""Romanesque Revival,"" costs $24, while the bar's namesake cocktail, comprised of rye, vodka, raw Kumamoto oysters and Royal Ossetra caviar, goes for $100.
A previous version of the bar menu, tweeted in September, shows ""Romanesque Revival"" at $20, and other cocktails from $16 to $21 -- hardly a bargain, but certainly more affordable.

841,"But after a divisive election season and a campaign rife with rhetoric against Muslims and immigrants, Trump has not attracted a wealth of star power to his Inaugural Ceremony.
Plans are far from settled, but as the days until the inauguration tick down, Trump's swearing-in ceremony won't include performances from the big name acts like Beyoncé and Yo-Yo Ma who took the stage for President Barack Obama.
And for the record, Trump and his team have said they are fine with that.
Boris Epshteyn, director of communications for the Inaugural Committee, dismissed the absence of major musicians in an interview on CNN in December.
""This is not Woodstock,"" Epshteyn said. ""It's not summer jam. It's not a concert.""
One evening earlier in December, Trump tweeted his own disdain for high profile celebrities, writing, ""The so-called 'A' list celebrities are all wanting tix to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!""

This page will update as the situation changes, but here is who the team has officially announced so far.
Talladega Marching Tornadoes
The marching band for Talladega College inked an agreement to perform at the event, but as 2017 came, the issue sparked a days-long debate in the historically black college.
Talladega College President Billy C. Hawkins announced the final decision in a statement, noting that the ""lessons students can learn from this experience cannot be taught in a classroom.""
""We respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade,"" said Hawkins. ""As many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said, we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power.""
Supporters of the trip argued that the experience would benefit the band -- and be a source of pride for the relatively unknown school.
The Rockettes
The Inaugural Committee announced in December the Rockettes would bring their iconic New York act to the nation's capital. But in the days and weeks that followed, some degree of controversy emerged.
Apparently worried about being associated with the divisive President-elect, several members of the dance group balked at being forced to perform. However, the organization said only those who were willing to perform would do so.
Several members of the Rockettes came forward to talk about their concerns with the group taking part in the inaugural festivities, and eventually one member leaked a recording to Marie Claire of a discussion between members of the Rockettes and Madison Square Garden executive chairman James Dolan.
As Dolan tried to explain his decision to have the Rockettes perform for Trump, one dancer said, ""It sounds like you're asking us to be tolerant of intolerance.""
Dolan responded, ""Yeah, in a way, I guess we are doing that.""
Before closing the meeting he offered something in the way of a ""sound bite,"" saying, ""We're celebrating a new president, not necessarily this president.""
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir has performed at five past inaugural ceremonies, and in 2017, they are set for a sixth. The choir is an award-winning, volunteer institution within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The group is based out of Salt Lake City, Utah, and dates back to the founding of the Mormon Church.
It has some 360 members, but the decision to participate in Trump's Inauguration caused one member to leave.
Jan Chamberlin said she was dropping out of the group and wrote on Facebook with reference to the inaugural performance: ""I only know I could never 'throw roses to Hitler.' And I certainly could never sing for him.""
Jackie Evancho
The biggest -- and only so far -- solo singer booked to perform at Trump's inauguration is former ""America's Got Talent"" contestant Jackie Evancho.
Like Trump, she is a former reality TV star. Unlike him, she is a sixteen-year-old woman with a charting record.
She appeared on the TV contest at just ten years old, eventually making it to second place. Since then she has recorded and released several albums. In 2010 , she performed at the White House Christmas tree lighting and performed again for Obama at the 2012 National Prayer Breakfast.
Despite her performing twice at Obama events, Trump cast her as part of his ""movement"" and correlated her agreement to perform at his Inauguration for her successful 2016 Christmas album.
""Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance. Some people just don't understand the 'Movement,'"" Trump tweeted.

The day before: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down, Lee Greenwood
Trump's inaugural committee announced several acts for a concert to kick things off the day before the inauguration itself.
On January 19, the committee says country starts Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood in addition to the band 3 Doors Down would highlight what the team is calling ""The Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration.""
""Above all, it will serve as tribute to one of our greatest attributes, the peaceful transition of partisan power,"" said chairman of the committee Tom Barrack in a statement.
The Piano Guys, The Frontmen of Country and others have also been slated for the kickoff event. Jon Voight, an actor and longtime attendee of major Republican events, was also set to stop by.
Sam Moore, one half of the soul duo Sam and Dave, announced on Tuesday that he would also perform at ""The Make American Great Again! Welcome Celebration."" The duo was active from the 1960s through the 1980s and were inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, four years after Dave Prater's death.
In the face of criticism against performers taking part in the inaugural festivities, Keith spoke out, saying he would not ""apologize.""
""I performed at events for previous Presidents Bush and Obama and over 200 shows in Iraq and Afghanistan for the USO,"" Keith told Entertainment Weekly
Greenwood was best known for his song ""God Bless the USA."" President George W. Bush appointed Greenwood to the National Council on the Arts, where he served a six-year term.
He has performed alongside Republican politicians several times in the past, including in a campaign video for then-presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio and at the 1988 Republican National Convention alongside President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan.
The inaugural committee also announced another pre-inaugural celebration, called ""Voices of the People,"" which the team said ""will feature groups from the hundreds of applications received by the Presidential Inaugural Committee to take part in inaugural festivities.""
It said these included the DC Fire Department Emerald Society Pipes and Drums, the Republican Hindu Coalition, the Montgomery Area High School Marching Band and several others.
Who has turned it down, and who is still considering?
Reports emerged that Sir Elton John had agreed to perform at the Inauguration, but representatives for the artist said he would not play.

President Barack Obama and Trump have fostered a phone relationship that's weathered bumps
Washington (CNN) Staffs for the incoming and outgoing administrations are forging what both sides describe as effective, even sometimes warm, working relationships in the weeks before Inauguration Day, even as their visions for the country remain deeply at odds.
Over lunch, in West Wing meetings and in phone calls and emails, aides to President Barack Obama and his successor, Donald Trump, are hashing out the complicated logistics of transferring the federal government between the two who seem at odds on about nearly every political issue.
Aides on both sides characterize the affable spirit as a necessity to an effective transition. Without ample and direct communication between teams, essential information about operating the vast federal machinery could be lost.
Sharing advice on more personal topics, like how to balance family and the grind of a high-level administration post, has also helped foster ties between the current and future White Houses. Despite the drawn faces and tears from Obama's staff on the day after the election, most have concluded that helping their counterparts succeed remains a critical duty.
Obama and Trump themselves have fostered a phone relationship that's weathered bumps in the two months since Election Day. Even after Trump suggested in a tweet the transition was being hampered by Obama administration ""roadblocks,"" the two men appeared to smooth things out during a phone call.

844,"Story highlights Democrats plan to put Trump on trial through his nominees
They're threatening to make life painful for the GOP if they move too fast on confirmations
Washington (CNN) Senate Democrats are unveiling their strategy in fighting President-elect Donald Trump's nominees to his Cabinet, even as they have little hope of blocking any of them: Show us your papers.
Democrats are maneuvering to claim the interests of the American people on their side, with a rallying cry of transparency. They're decrying a combination of quick hearings -- several key nominees will testify next week -- with what they say is a slow pace of nominees returning standard paperwork for vetting.
They want to put Trump on trial through his nominees, using the billionaires he's nominated to his Cabinet to call attention to conflicts of interest, and using conservative nominees to show how Trump has reversed course from previous campaign promises, according to aides and senators.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats want at least two days to review each nominee, full paperwork, tax returns for many of the nominees with complex financial records, and hearings spread out so members can attend as many as they want.
""There are a lot of questions about these nominees,"" Schumer said. ""And I would like to succeed in negotiating something but we get full and fair hearings. ... There are so many issues about so many of them that to rush them through would be a disservice to the American people.""

845,"(CNN) In meetings with senators ahead of his confirmation next week, secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson articulated a realist, conservative view of the world this week that one source described as ""diametrically opposed"" to many of the ideas touted by his future boss, President-elect Donald Trump.
But lawmakers still said they have concerns about the incoming administration's Russia policy.
Senators and senate aides from both parties said that Tillerson made a good first impression in his meetings this week, but they were still looking for a clear statement on Russia during his testimony next week.
""He is at heart a conservative businessman, with a worldview that has been shaped by mainstream Republican principles,"" one aide told CNN. ""Every nominee has to contend with how their views fit in with the administration they are entering, but with Tillerson, I think an important question next week will be at what point do his moral convictions and what he knows to be true contrast with the president he is about to serve?""
Several sources said that Tillerson projected a clear-eyed view toward Russia, including the need to get tough with President Vladimir Putin.
""He indicated that he knew what Putin was about and that you need to deal with Russia from a position of strength. He framed his relationship with Putin as one where he felt he could talk to him frankly and that he was prepared to do that,"" another staffer told CNN. ""He gave good answers and I can say the tone was encouraging.""
Sen. John McCain, who described his meeting Wednesday with Tillerson as ""good"" and productive,"" said he had additional questions and concerns about Russia he hoped Tillerson would address.
""He satisfied some of my concerns,"" McCain told reporters Wednesday, but added, ""I have additional concerns.""
Sources said Tillerson would not be drawn into the ongoing dispute between the President-elect and the intelligence community over Russian interference in the US presidential election and avoided discussing specific policies the incoming Trump administration may pursue.
While he voiced skepticism as CEO of ExxonMobil about the effectiveness of sanctions, Tillerson acknowledged in his meetings with senators that sanctions could be a useful policy tool, although he declined to endorse any particular sanctions.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said Tillerson's views on international relations -- including Russia -- are very much in the ""mainstream of foreign policy thinking here in the US.""
Corker, who will oversee Tillerson's confirmation hearings, met with the former ExxonMobil chief executive Tuesday.
Asked if he expects Tillerson, who has a relationship with Putin and has cut business deals in that country, will lead a robust policy towards Russia, Corker said yes. That's been a key concern of several GOP senators, including McCain.
""I had a long private conversion with him. I had talked to him on the phone prior to that,"" said Corker, who was also reportedly under consideration by Trump for the secretary of state position. ""I think what people are going to find when they hear Tillerson in the hearing is that he's very, very much in the mainstream of US foreign policy thinking.""
Senate Democrats were also heartened by Tillerson's comments about climate change and his support of climate science.
""He stressed, for me, his background in science and that he is a believer in science,"" said Sen. Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after his meeting on Wednesday. ""That also was encouraging. So we did have a rather, I think a lengthy discussion about climate change issues and the importance of conservation and what we need to do in countries around the world where extreme poverty has denied many people access to a reasonable energy accessibility.""
Sen. Chris Coons, another Democrat on the committee, said he was ""generally encouraged"" by some of Tillerson's answers during their meeting, as well as his openness and humility, but had not decided whether to support his nomination.
Tillerson is expected to give two days of testimony next week. Before then, senators and their aides are combing over documents he has provided to the committee.
Although he didn't provide his tax returns, he did provide an extensive financial disclosure and ethics agreement. Senate aides say they are closely reviewing a plan ExxonMobil released this week to pay out Tillerson's holdings in the company -- which will net him about $180 million to be put into a blind trust. He also provided various speeches he had given as CEO of ExxonMobil and information on legal cases the company faced under his leadership.
Despite Tillerson's impressive performance, senators and aides said concerns linger about the incoming administration's Russia policy, which was expected to be a focus of his confirmation hearing next week.
""Russia is not a friend of the United States. We have serious concerns about Russia. I think that's a strong bipartisan message that you're going to hear during the confirmation process,"" Cardin said. ""Obviously, he did business with Russia. He was able to get things done there and those relationships will be subject to questioning during the confirmation hearings.""
Another senator wary of Russia conceded that ""Tillerson wasn't the problem,"" but warned that Trump's refusal to acknowledge Russia's interference in the election could slow his confirmation.
""If Trump has an intelligence briefing on Russia on Friday and still denies the intel pointing to Russia is reliable, we are going to have a problem,"" the senator told CNN. ""Trump's nominees will have to pick sides -- between the intel and Trump.""",neutral

""When someone that's respected comes in, you can just tell -- it's a walks-on-water type feeling there""
Washington (CNN) Republicans on Capitol Hill are still feeling out President-elect Donald Trump -- but they're warmly embracing his vice president, Mike Pence.
Pence held court in private meetings with GOP members of the House, and then the Senate, on Wednesday.
Those visits are set to become more permanent: Like Dick Cheney, the soon-to-be vice president will have office space in both the Senate -- where he technically presides as president and will cast tie-breaking votes -- and the House, too. He also plans to attend weekly policy lunches, positioning Pence as President-elect's chief fixer on Capitol Hill.
It's too early to tell what role Pence will play in setting policy -- or whether he will consistently speak for the Trump administration on policy matters in a world where Trump can change the agenda with one tweet. But Republicans were gushing about the man they see as Trump's good cop -- one who bridges conservative divides where Trump at times deepens them -- just 16 days from inauguration.
""I think it makes a unique situation -- somebody who was elected in the class of 2000; somebody who understands the speed at which the House works. To have somebody like that as an advocate in the White House is going to prove to be very beneficial to us in the days ahead,"" said Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee -- the same role Pence once held when he was a member of Congress.

(CNN) Donald Trump strongly condemned WikiLeaks in a 2010 interview, calling its actions ""spying"" and ""espionage"" and saying its members would be shot within 24 hours if they were in a country like China.
Those comments are a sharp contrast to Trump's current position on WikiLeaks, which published leaked documents from prominemt Democratic officials during the election. During a rally in October of last year, Trump exclaimed ""I love WikiLeaks."" Just this week, Trump cited the group's founder, Julian Assange, who claimed in an interview that Russia was not involved in hacking during the U.S. election. CNN's KFile reported on Wednesday that Trump called WikiLeaks ""disgraceful"" and said ""there should be like death penalty or something"" in another December 2010 interview.
During the interview with Fox Business Network's ""Follow the Money,"" Trump, who was considering a run for president, brought up WikiLeaks on his own accord as an example of a decline of America's prestige. At the time, WikiLeaks was publishing classified material leaks to them by Pfc. Chelsea Manning, who was then known as Pfc. Bradley Manning.
""You look at WikiLeaks, I mean, in China, if this would've happened the people would get a bullet through their head within 24 hours and here in this country we're embarrassed, everybody's embarrassed,"" Trump said. ""We're calling the leaders of other countries horrible names -- how do you go back and negotiate with people with that. That's just not the way life works. As far as I'm concerned it's spying, it's espionage.""
""They should try that young -- they call him private first class -- I call him private last class. They should try that young private and they should frankly either put him in jail for the rest of his life or maybe get the death penalty,"" continued Trump. ""You know, in the old days if you were a spy and that's what he is you'd get the death penalty.""

Washington (CNN) Former CIA Director James Woolsey downplayed his role Thursday in President-elect Donald Trump's transition, days after he publicly disputed the President-elect's views on Russia's role in the 2016 election.
In a statement, he formally announced he would no longer serve as an adviser to Trump. But he insisted in an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett that the move had nothing to do with his comments on Russia, only that he wanted to avoid any confusion about his role with Trump.
Earlier this week, Woolsey told CNN's Jim Sciutto he believed the Russians were involved in election-related hackings of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Then, speaking to CNN's Don Lemon on Wednesday , Woolsey criticized WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, whom Trump has invoked on Twitter to defend his skepticism of US intelligence assessments of Russian meddling in the election.
Woolsey insisted to Burnett Thursday that he was not leaving because he was frustrated with Trump's public dismissal of US intelligence findings. He said he had actually not advised Trump in some time and wanted to set the record straight on who he was and what he did.
""I didn't want to fly under false colors,"" Woolsey said. ""I'm not really functioning as an adviser anymore, and so when I'm on the screen, everybody announces that I'm former CIA director and that I'm a Trump adviser. And I'm really not anymore. So I just thought I should strike that from the (TV banner) ... so nobody was under false impressions.""

852,"Story highlights The members of the Ohio GOP's state central committee are slated to vote Friday morning
Trump is working the phones
(CNN) Fifteen days from his presidential inauguration, President-elect Donald Trump is looking to settle some scores.
The President-elect spent part of his day Thursday dialing Ohio Republicans in the hopes of swaying their decision in Friday's vote for Ohio Republican Party chairman, according to a source familiar with the calls.
Matt Borges, the current GOP chairman who was critical of Trump at times during the presidential campaign, is facing a challenge from prominent GOP donor Jane Timken. She's billed herself as the Trump-esque Republican in the race and drawn support from Bob Paduchik, who ran Trump's successful campaign trouncing Hillary Clinton in Ohio.
The 66 elected members of the Ohio GOP's state central committee are slated to vote Friday morning -- and Trump is working the phones.
Greg Simpson, a 66-year-old member of the state central committee, thought he was in for a pre-recorded message when his phone rang Thursday afternoon and a young woman said she was calling on behalf of Trump.

853,"(CNN) President-elect Donald Trump completed a deposition Thursday over his legal battle against chef José Andrés, Trump transition team spokeswoman Hope Hicks told CNN.
Trump sued Andres for breach of contract after the chef backed out of a plan for a restaurant in Trump's new luxury hotel in Washington. Andres claimed he canceled plans for the project after Trump made disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants during his presidential campaign.
Alan Garten, executive vice president and general counsel for Trump Organization, said the deposition lasted ""just over one hour"" and described the case as ""fairly straightforward.""
""In short, the parties entered into a valid and enforceable lease, which the tenant clearly breached by walking out and failing to perform its obligations, thereby entitling the landlord to recover damages in the form of unpaid rent, cost of build out, lost profits and other expenses,"" Garten said in a statement.
Neither Hicks nor Garten specified where the deposition took place but the President-elect has been in Trump Tower in New York all day Thursday.

855,"Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials.
The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall.
Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed.
""The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!"" Trump tweeted Friday.
The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!
New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico.
""When you understand that Mexico's economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play,"" Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""On the trade negotiation side, I don't think it's that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that it's in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall.""
The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they'd like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said.
""It was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that's already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure the border,"" Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday.
Messer admitted it's ""big dollars, but it's a question of priorities."" He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion.
""Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence,"" Messer said.
Mexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall.
If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown.
No decisions have been made, GOP sources said.
Republicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort.
The thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time.
Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall.
""We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,"" Scalise said. ""We're in talks with him on the details of it as they're still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there's another funding bill that's going to move. We're going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall.""
Could Mexico pay for the border wall?
Trump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion . And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the wall's full cost.
According to Trump's website , those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas; and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico.
A major challenge for judging Trump's proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket -- less than $1 billion -- compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money -- remittance seizure -- would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash.
Total US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ( $186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year ), so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And it's difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on Mexican exports -- or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff -- without the specifics of the tax.
Moving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that ""even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year."" But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year -- and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees -- that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag.
The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country.
Trump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trump's plan would likely face multiple legal battles.
""The Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the 'Radical Islamic Terrorists' that the Patriot Act was designed to fight,"" says Callan. ""The courts are likely to view Mr. Trump's use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut.""
The size of Mexico's remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, it's difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall.",positive

859,"Talladega, Alabama (CNN) The president of a historically black college in Alabama has yet to decide whether the school's marching band will perform at President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural parade, a college spokeswoman said Wednesday.
The Talladega College Marching Tornadoes band was among 40 organizations that accepted an invitation to take part in the inaugural parade after the January 20 swearing in, according to an initial list released Friday by Trump's inaugural committee.
The possibility that the band from the 149-year-old college , founded by former slaves in the small town of Talladega, could perform sparked controversy -- and resulted in two dueling petitions.
College President Billy C. Hawkins has the petitions -- one organized by a current student in favor of performing and the other by a Talladega graduate against taking part -- CNN affiliate WVTM reported.
Hawkins was expected to announce his decision Wednesday, school spokesman Greg Wilson told CNN. But another school official, spokeswoman Veronica Clark-Holland, told CNN late Wednesday that any decision was unlikely to be announced during the evening.
Clark-Holland said Hawkins had been meeting with board members all day, but no decision had been reached. Hawkins was scheduled to appear Wednesday on ""CNN Tonight"" with Don Lemon, but canceled the appearance.

""In view of his behavior and comments I strongly do not want Talladega College to give the appearance of supporting him,"" she wrote. The petition had more than 900 supporters by Tuesday night.
Trump has made what many view as disparaging comments about people of color, including saying that Mexico was sending its worst citizens over the border.
""Some are good and some are rapists and some are killers. We don't even know what we're getting,"" he said in 2015.

Trump has also used the word ""ghettos"" referring to the inner cities when he described issues faced by African-Americans in the starkest terms.
""The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We're going to work with the African-American community and we're going to solve the problem of the inner city,"" he said in 2016. ""We're going to bring safety back. You can't walk out on the street, you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot.""
About 'the experience' students will get
In the second petition, Talladega student and band member Dollan Young wrote: ""We believe that this parade is not about politics it's about seeing first hand the process of a transition.""
Young wrote that taking part in the inaugural would not be in support of a political party, but rather ""about the experience that the students will obtain.""
His petition had garnered close to 200 signatures by Tuesday night.
Another band member, Shylexis Robinson, told CNN affiliate WVTM she was excited and felt the performance would ""put our school on the map.""
Robinson said it wasn't ""about Donald Trump himself, it's about our school. And I'm all about our school and all about the band.""
Performance wouldn't 'uplift' Talladega
Edna Garrett, of Talladega, told WVTM that being associated with Trump and negativity surrounding him wouldn't benefit Talladega.
""I don't really see how it would uplift the school in any way,"" she said.
Talladega College, founded in 1867, is Alabama's oldest private historically black liberal arts college, according to the school's website.
It's band, though, is relatively young.
Wilson said the 297-member band started in 2012 and recently performed in New Orleans at the halftime show for a National Football League game between the New Orleans Saints and the Denver Broncos.
One artist invited to perform at Trump's festivities has said she would do so -- with one requirement.
This week, Rebecca Ferguson , a former runner-up on the British version of ""X Factor,"" said on Twitter she had been invited and would take part if she could perform ""Strange Fruit.""
The song protested racism and addressed lynching in the South. It was made famous by the late Billie Holiday, a renowned jazz musician.
In a statement posted to Ferguson's Twitter account Monday night, she said the song ""has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the United States for being too controversial.
A song that speaks to all the disregarded and downtrodden black people in the United States. A song that is a reminder of how love is the only thing that will conquer all the hatred in this world, then I will graciously accept your invitation and see you in Washington. Best Rebecca X.""
The lyrics, written in the 1930s by Jewish communist Abel Meeropol, were composed as a protest poem to highlight racism in America's southern states.
The song's opening lyrics are: ""Southern trees bear strange fruit / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root /Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze / Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.""
Controversy among announced performers
The inaugural committee has announced three acts so far: the Radio City Rockettes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and 16-year-old ""America's Got Talent"" star Jackie Evancho.
But there still is controversy surrounding the group of committed performers. A member of the Mormon choir, which has performed at five presidential inaugurations, quit. Jan Chamberlin said the performance would betray her values
Last month, the Madison Square Garden Company said in a statement that individual Rockettes wouldn't be compelled to participate at the inauguration after one dancer in the group, Phoebe Pearl, reportedly protested on Instagram.
Her post has since been deleted.
In November Sir Elton John refused an invitation to perform at the inauguration -- denying a claim made by the vice-chair of Trump's presidential inaugural committee that the singer was slated to perform.

864,"He has showered praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him ""very smart!,"" and dismissed charges that Moscow tried to hack the election process -- even as he's bashed China for currency manipulation, skewing trade and failing to rein in North Korea.
It's unusual enough for a president-elect to try to sway foreign policy before he's in office, let alone in 140-character bursts. While Trump aides have said some of his statements shouldn't be taken ""literally,"" the tweets offer insight to his foreign policy views and raise a question: When both China and Russia are challenging US power globally, why does he favor Moscow and not Beijing?
Trump's positions on Russia and China mark a sharp turn from current policies -- and that might to the point. Trump and much of the Republican establishment have made clear they aim to dismantle parts of President Barack Obama's legacy. Trump is also looking to use international relations in pursuit of economic ends, even as some observers worry his approach is based on misperceptions of economic forces.
Some analysts point to the possibility that Trump is taking a deeply strategic approach; others say he simply fails to understand the crucial importance of long-standing US alliances. At the least, it is an approach that contrasts with Obama, who has tried to find areas of common interest with China to bridge serious divides. At the same time, he has endeavored, with little success, to isolate Russia for a series of international violations.

""It's a sign of confusion if you're making trouble with the Chinese at the same time as you're making trouble with US allies in Asia, and it's a sign of confusion if you're trying to make up with Russia at the same that you're not tending to American alliances in Europe,"" said Steven Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Trump ""acts like a guy who thinks he can make everybody mad at the same time and not pay a price for it,"" Sestanovich said.
Russia has conducted a stealth invasion of Ukraine, annexed Crimea -- the first attempt to alter European borders by force since World War II -- and is believed to have supplied the missile that brought down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, shot down over Ukraine in 2014.
Moscow has supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war, including in the bombing of civilians in Aleppo, in direct opposition to the US. The Russian military has buzzed US aircraft and ships. And the US intelligence community found with ""high confidence"" that Russia was behind hacking during the presidential election campaign meant to sow doubts about American democracy.
And yet Trump speaks warmly of Putin and his desire for better cooperation with Russia, publicly dismissing the hacking allegations and accusing the intelligence community of acting politically.
That stand has damaged morale within the intelligence community and puzzled observers who wonder whether it's a strategic decision or a function of Trump's admiration for authoritarian figures, possible business deals with Russian oligarchs, or as-yet-undiscovered links or financial debts. Russian officials have said they were in contact with the Trump campaign throughout the election.
Matt Rojansky, head of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center, said one reason could be Trump's belief that the US should do more work with Russia to defeat terrorism and his view of that challenge as a ""civilizational battle between radical Islam and, broadly speaking, the forces of Western civilization.""
Trump and his aides, particularly his future national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, are much more comfortable including Russia under the ""Western civilization"" umbrella than prominent Republicans such as Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Rojansky said. That will cause friction, possibly sooner rather than later.
McCain will hold hearings Thursday to examine Russia's role in the election hacking. The Arizona senator and Graham have announced that they will also lead new sanctions against Russia. McCain already is working on legislation with the leading Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin.
If Trump's stance on Russia might fray some of his alliances in Congress, he's already put European allies on edge with his warmth toward Putin and questions about the worth of NATO. He's also unnerved Asian allies by questioning the cost of helping Japan and South Korea defend themselves.
""I can see why it's a temptation for a big shot like Trump to think that smaller powers don't matter and you just solve your problems with the other big guys,"" said Sestanovich, who is also a professor at Columbia University. ""That's just a mistake. The other guys are going to eat your lunch if you have let American alliance ties wither. I think that's what he doesn't get.""
He said that, ""The biggest lever we have with the Chinese is our network of alliances, similarly with the Russians.""

Some analysts have suggested Trump is practicing a sophisticated version of the ""triangular diplomacy"" former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and President Richard Nixon used to play the Soviet Union and China off against each other in the 1970s.
But the two nations are no longer bitter enemies and instead have a well-defined, if mutually wary, relationship.
""There's no way by improving relations with Russia you get a significant bang for your buck with the Chinese,"" Sestanovich said.
China, like Russia, has targeted the US with cyberattacks. Beijing has pushed US companies in China to give up proprietary technology, it has contested US claims to freedom of navigation through Asian waters, its military has buzzed US naval vessels and Air Force jets, and it recently stole a US underwater drone.
If Trump seems to look the other way on Russian transgressions, China gets no free pass.
The President-elect, who manufactures parts of his clothing line in China, often charges that Beijing steals American jobs with unfair trade practices. ""China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!"" he tweeted Monday. Soon after winning the presidency, he antagonized Beijing by holding a phone conversation with Taiwan's leader.
Trump has long made China a bogeyman, accusing it in a 2012 tweet of having ""created"" the concept of global warming in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive. He has particularly fixated on China's economic practices, blasting it on trade and currency throughout the presidential race and blaming it for the loss of American jobs. Trade and job losses were central rallying cries of his campaign.
Richard Bush, director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, said Trump's criticisms reflect a lack of understanding about international economics. ""The jobs China is accused of stealing, many were lost a long time ago to Korea or Japan and moved from there to China,"" he said. ""A lot of that job loss occurred because of technology change,"" he said.
And despite Trump's promises to bring jobs back to the US, Bush said, ""Nobody in the US would do them at the wages companies would want to charge. Those jobs are never going to be gotten back.""
Bush also pointed out that there are limits to how much any US president can change relations with China. ""Will the American business community sit idly by and watch Trump undertake a trade war with China? They have a lot at stake in this,"" he said.
In the meantime, Trump's stream of anti-Chinese Tweets poses risks, he said.
While Trump might be trying to create bargaining positions or exert pressure, his tweets might be misunderstood, Bush said, creating the chance that ""China would regard a potential challenge as more dangerous than it actually might be.""",negative

866,"Story highlights Schumer said Trump told him he liked him more than Republican leaders
""My guiding light is going to be the principles of our party,"" Schumer said
(CNN) Sen. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic Senate leader, said Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump told him he liked him more than Republican leaders in Congress.
But the New York Democrat told CNN's Dana Bash he would remain skeptical of Trump's effort to ""flatter"" him.
""When you get to be in my position, people do tend to want to flatter you and you've got to take it with a grain of salt,"" Schumer said.
The New York Post reported Sunday that Trump told Schumer, who supported Hillary Clinton, that he liked him more than Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Asked by Bash about the report, Schumer acknowledged, ""He said something close to it.""

867,"(CNN) Chuck Schumer arrived for his first day as Senate Democratic leader to a large, new Capitol suite still strewn with unpacked boxes.
""It's a little fancier than I'm used to, but it goes with the territory,"" Schumer told us, as he sat down for his maiden television interview as the Senate's top Democrat.
Schumer was hoping to be the new Democratic Senate majority leader, working with Hillary Clinton in the White House. Instead, he is leading the Trump opposition. The former would have been more fun, he conceded, but he says being minority leader now is ""more important.""
Here's how he described a recent phone conversation with Donald Trump: ""I said, 'Mr. President-elect, you went after both the Democratic and Republican establishments when you ran; you were an anti-establishment change candidate. But by your Cabinet picks and your early pronouncements, you seem to be embracing your timeworn, shop-worn hard right,'"" he recalled.
""If you do that, your presidency will not come close to being a success,"" he told Trump.
For Schumer, success will be even more complicated. He has to walk a very fine line between when to work with Trump, and when to oppose him. Schumer describes it as ""accountability.""
""The only way we're going to work with him is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues,"" Schumer said.
""90-95% of the time, we'll be holding his feet to the fire, holding him accountable. But we're Democrats, we're not going to just oppose things to oppose them,"" he added.
Schumer started his congressional career in the House in 1981, and served there until successfully defeating longtime Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
He climbed the Democratic ranks as a fierce partisan and prolific fundraiser, but in recent years turned his attention to also becoming a successful legislator who can work across the aisle. He played a key role in crafting bipartisan Senate immigration reform in 2013, though the bill stalled in the House and never became law.
Schumer loves being the center of deal making, a lot like the incoming president.
""Well, here's the problem. The Republicans in the Senate and the House have been run by a hard right group,"" said Schumer.
But what about now that they have a dealmaker in the White House?
""Look, we're going to look at the specifics,"" Schumer said. ""And on the overwhelming bunch of it, particularly given who he's chosen as his Cabinet people, we're going to have to oppose him because we just disagree in principle.""
""Of course I'd like to make a deal,"" he added.
Many progressives scoff at the notion of Schumer even considering any form of compromise with Trump.
Democracy for America, a leading progressive group, said: ""Democratic leaders from Chuck Schumer down need to stop playing footsie with Trump and pretending we can find.""
Schumer's response: ""We're playing no footsie. My views are exactly the same as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.""
""If we can work with him and be true to our principles, we're not going to reject him. But overall, we're sticking to our principles,"" he said.
The two New Yorkers have a history. Schumer says he doesn't know Trump well, but he was one Schumer's of early political donors. Schumer confirmed New York Post reporting that the President-elect told him he likes him better than GOP leaders.
The new Democratic leader said he wasn't surprised, but also not flattered.
""When you get to be in my position, people do tend to want to flatter you and you've got to take it with a grain of salt,"" he said.
Trump is hardly Schumer's only concern. He's also going to be the de facto leader of the movement to fix the defeated Democratic Party.
""What we have to do is look at this election in the eye and see what we did wrong. I think we know what we did wrong. We have always been a party with a sharp-edged economic message that talks about helping the middle class and people who want to get to the middle class get there more easily. We didn't have that in this election,"" Schumer said. ""So that even though Trump's positions were much further away from where the middle class is and what they want, he seemed to be the person talking to them.""
The New York Democrat says he will help his party craft what he calls a ""focused and sharp-edged message.""
""And here's the good news. Some people say, 'Which direction do you go in? The old Obama coalition or the new blue collar?' If we have a sharp-edged economic message, it unites our party. It unites Joe Manchin (a West Virginia moderate) to Bernie Sanders (a Vermont liberal), both of whom are on my leadership team,"" Schumer said.
""It unites the blue-collar worker in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the college student paying her loans in Los Angeles, the single mom in Harlem who's on minimum wage,"" he said, seeming to take the message for a test-drive.
It may be just the task for the man who put himself on the political map in the1980s by being media savvy. It was then that he realized that Sundays were a great day to make news (especially the New York Times), so he started holding regular Sunday news conferences.
In the 1990s, one of the running jokes in Washington was that the most dangerous place in to be in the District was between Schumer and a television camera (Schumer says it was originally former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's line after Schumer used his publicity prowess to push through the Brady gun law).
But that's no longer true. Over the past several years, Schumer has tried to be more disciplined. He's more likely to either be on his cell phone in the Capitol hallways, or pretend to be, in order to avoid talking to reporters
""In the early days, the press was a very good way to bring out problems that needed to be fixed. Now, I have other levers of power, so I'm hardly inaccessible. And you can say a lot of bad things about Chuck Schumer and accessibility is never going to be one of them,"" Schumer said with a knowing laugh.
The same goes for authenticity. Though he proudly declared that he bought a new suit for his first day as leader, he is clearly still the same rumpled guy who slept for 30-plus years on a mattress next to the kitchen in a rundown group house owned by former Rep. George Miller.
He now lives in an apartment, which is why he told us he is excited to have a large balcony outside his Capitol office.
""We're going to try to find out if we can have barbeques,"" Schumer said with genuine excitement.
After a few more minutes, the New Yorker told us he had to get back to work. After all, he laughed, he can't spend all his time doing press.",negative

870,"Story highlights Trump inherits over 100 federal court vacancies
Experts say the incoming President could reshape the federal judiciary
Washington (CNN) Donald Trump is poised to cement the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, but he will also play a critical role in reshaping the look of the lower courts as he moves to fill over 100 vacancies in the federal judiciary.
Experts say that the unusually high number of vacancies -- due in part to judicial warfare between the Obama administration and the Republican-led Senate -- could change the face of the courts.
""If President-elect Trump can put a different face on the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals he could substantially change the course of federal jurisprudence,"" said Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution.
As things stand now, there are 103 vacancies in the appeals and district courts. The Administrative Office of the US Courts defines 38 of those as judicial ""emergencies,"" or those where vacancies have existed for an extended period of time in areas with a high number of filings.
For comparison, President Barack Obama had 59 vacancies when he took office.

871,"""North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!"" Trump tweeted.
Trump quickly followed that up with a charge that China was doing nothing to help the US cope with the rogue nation.
North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!
""China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!"" Trump wrote.
The President-elect launched his verbal missiles after the autocratic 32-year-old North Korean leader declared in a televised New Year's Day speech that his military is on the brink of testing its first intercontinental ballistic missile: a rocket that can be equipped with nuclear weapons and is powerful enough to reach any part of the US.
A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded Tuesday to Trump, saying, ""China's efforts in resolving the North Korea nuclear issue have been obvious to all. Our contribution has been widely recognized by the international community. As the host of the six-nation talks, our efforts and achievements have been clear to all.""
Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program (EANP) said Trump's tweets were ""foolish, but probably harmless.""
""I think North Korea will probably test the KN-08 (intercontinental ballistic missile) this year, no matter what Trump tweets,"" he said in an email to CNN.
While US officials and military experts doubt many of Kim's boasts, Trump may very well have to deal with an ICBM test and confront the danger Pyongyang poses to international stability.
North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017
The hermit nation poses a unique threat. While the nuclear nations of China and Russia are both pushing back against US power across the globe, they are more integrated into the international system and neither is as erratic or threatening. This all moves Pyongyang to Trump's front burner as a simmering problem that might soon boil over.
Kim declared Sunday that his goal was ""to cope against the vicious threats for nuclear war by the Imperialists,"" a sinister nod to the US and its Asian allies.
Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was asked on ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday what the President-elect intended to do to stop North Korea's nukes.
""He's not stated that publicly, and he won't before he's inaugurated,"" Conway said.
""But we do know that there are sanctions that are possible,"" she added. ""They have not always worked. I think China would have to have a significant role here as well. But he's putting North Korea on notice through this tweet and other statements that this won't happen. He, as President of the United States, wants to stand between them and their missile capabilities, which experts say could be deployed to reach Seattle almost immediately.""
North Korea has been steadily working to improve its missile and weapons capability, conducting a fifth nuclear test in September.
American analysts say there are still questions about Pyongyang's claims of technological advances -- particularly to key elements required to deliver a nuclear payload -- but the picture is still worrisome.
JUST WATCHED N. Korea claims it's close to testing an ICBM Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH N. Korea claims it's close to testing an ICBM 01:37
""It's a very real and growing threat,"" said Bruce Klinger, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. ""Think Don Corleone, but with nuclear weapons.""
North Korea might be easy to ridicule as ""the funny little country, with the funny little guy, with the funny little hairstyle out of Jersey Shore,"" that can't even provide electricity to its people, Klingner said. But ""North Korea is a multi-spectrum threat to the US, its allies and international peace and security.""
""This is the worst regime in the world trying to acquire the worst weapons in the world and the means to reach the US with them,"" Victor Cha, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said of North Korea. ""In terms of a direct threat to American security, this is it.""
Russian, Chinese threats differ
He said that threat is different than that from major powers Russia and China.
""With Russia and China, we're mutually deterred"" because of nuclear capabilities, he explained. ""With North Korea, you just don't know what this guy is going to do.""
Pyongyang has a million-man army poised along the border with South Korea, where US forces are based. The state engages in massive counterfeiting operations of the US $100 bill and in the manufacturing of methamphetamine. US security officials place it in the top five cyber threats worldwide. It has an estimated 16 to 20 nuclear weapons and is steadily working to miniaturize them and improve the range and accuracy of missiles to deliver them.
North Korea's new boast about an ICBM that could deliver those weapons to the US comes as Washington is undergoing a leadership transition -- always a fragile time -- and South Korea is in political disarray , with its president temporarily stripped of her powers because of corruption charges and facing a court ruling on whether she should be reinstated or removed from office.
Kim sees 2017 as ""an opportune time"" to complete development of a nuclear weapon because of these leadership challenges, according to a high-level North Korean diplomat who recently defected to South Korea. Kim is ""determined"" to complete development of a nuclear weapon by the end of 2017, the diplomat said at a December press briefing, according to Yonhap news agency.
""This is not just saber-rattling to get attention,"" Cha said. ""This is an actual military goal they're seeking.""
And they're well on their way, despite repeated international attempts over decades to slow Pyongyang's program through sanctions and diplomacy. North Korea conducted an unprecedented number of missile tests in 2016 and a satellite launch that experts call a sign that it has cleared significant hurdles toward ICBM technology.
It has already notched other potentially lethal successes.
Pyongyang fired a submarine-based ballistic missile in August, a weapon that South Korea has no viable defense against, said Klingner, a former chief of the CIA's Korea branch. After the test, the South Korean Defense Ministry revised its estimate on the North's ability to deploy submarine-launched missiles from around four years to as little as a year.
The country likely already has working nuclear warheads for its Nodong medium-range ballistic missile, which threatens all of South Korea and Japan, experts say.
And Pyongyang's intermediate range missile, the Musudan, can hit Guam, the location of a major US military base and a critical node in the defense of the western Pacific Ocean. It isn't clear whether North Korea has the ability to put a nuclear warhead on the Musudan yet.
The ICBM would be the next level up, putting the continental US within Pyongyang's deadly reach. US four-star generals, including Gen. Vincent Brooks, who leads US forces in South Korea, and Adm. Harry Harris, head of US Pacific Command, say North Korea is nearing that capability. Other experts don't think Pyongyang is quite there yet, but say it likely will be within Trump's first term.
Struggling to deliver nukes
Bruce Bennett, a a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, says that despite North Korea's apparent progress on a warhead, it doesn't yet have good enough missile and rocket technology to deliver a nuke.
A key question is whether they have the technology that would allow the missiles to re-enter the atmosphere. North Koreans have this capability for the intermediate range Musudan missile, which can hit South Korea and Japan. It's a harder technological feat to achieve re-entry capability for an ICBM, which is subject to higher temperatures and greater velocities.
For now, US military officials told CNN that they assess that North Korea still hasn't mastered that technology or key elements of firing and fuzing a weapon.
""They're likely further along than many experts and pundits give them credit for,"" according to Klingner. ""We may not know where they are on that path, but we know they're on it.""
Kim boasted in his New Year's remarks that his country has successfully tested a variety of ICBM technologies. ""Research and development of the cutting-edge tech weapons are actively progressing and strengthening our defense capabilities, including last-stage preparation of tests for intercontinental ballistic rocket launch have been continuously succeeding,"" he declared.
If the young leader goes ahead, an ICBM test would be a flagrant violation of numerous United Nations resolutions and beg a response from Trump.
The President-elect has called Kim a ""maniac,"" but has also said he would sit down and negotiate with him, a break from long-standing international norms.
A test would also deepen worries in South Korea and Japan, already rattled by suggestions from candidate Trump that the US should cover less of their defense and, in another violation of international norms, that they should develop their own nuclear programs.
Increasing tension with China
And it would immediately increase tensions between the US and North Korea's closest ally China, which Trump has suggested has ""total control"" over Pyongyang.
If China won't rein North Korea in, Trump has suggested the US should ""make trade very difficult"" with Beijing. He has also suggested that he would have China assassinate the North Korean leader to make him ""disappear in one form or another very quickly.""
Cha said the decision to stop North Korea from reaching the point where it could deter the US by threatening Honolulu or Los Angeles with destruction will be a personal one that the President-elect will likely have to make. While some experts estimate Pyongyang will have an ICBM by 2020, Cha thinks it will be sooner.
""If the President decides this can't stand, then all kinds of options open up for him"" to take action, Cha said, including significant shifts in the US force posture in Asia and exerting greater pressure on China.",negative

Of course, the 15 years since the September 11 attacks have been dominated by war, strife and economic disruption. But what makes 2017 so unique is that America -- long a force for stability -- is poised to inaugurate one of the most impulsive presidents ever to walk into the Oval Office.
Far from acting as a brake against turmoil sweeping the globe, America under Trump could exacerbate it. Nicholas Dungan, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, said uncertainty about the President-elect could widen divides in the transatlantic alliance, the bedrock of 70 years of Western stability.
""Donald Trump is in many respects the anti-Barack Obama,"" said Dungan, who teaches at Sciences Po, an international research university in France. ""With Obama, there was tremendous trust but very little performance. With Trump it looks like there will be a deficit of trust and a surfeit of action.""
World on edge
It's no wonder that Trump has the world on edge, despite arguments among supporters that the unpredictable statesmanship he has previewed in the presidential transition could strengthen the US position around the globe by keeping rivals off balance.
He has questioned US alliances that kept the peace for decades in Europe and Asia and suggested he will ""expand"" the US nuclear arsenal. He has spent his transition feuding with spy agencies that concluded Russia interfered in the election. And he signaled to China that the taboo topic of Taiwan is on the table, casting doubt on 40 years of diplomatic protocol.
The Trump effect could be all the more pronounced because the political equilibrium of much of the world has been upset, straining institutions and assumptions in international relations that have endured for decades. To judge how much has changed, and why the prospects of 2017 look so uncertain, it's worth looking back a year.
When 2016 dawned, Obama, fresh from an Iran nuclear deal and seeing Obamacare upheld by the Supreme Court had every reason to expect a Democratic successor would secure his legacy. Republicans were confidently waiting for an establishment champion to emerge from their primary to send Trump back to reality TV.
In Britain, David Cameron was basking in a surprising parliamentary majority won in a 2015 election. Most end-of-year polls predicted the Remain camp would win a referendum on membership in the European Union.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, Time Magazine's reigning Person of the Year , was lauded for her moral example in embracing desperate refugees from the Middle East and was Europe's undisputed leader.
And in Italy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was readying a trip to the US to receive Obama's blessing after harnessing hope and change as a successful political message of his own.
Unthinkable happened again and again and again
But within months, the unthinkable happened -- again, and again, and again.
In a blink of an eye, Cameron was gone, felled by a referendum in which voters who felt economically and culturally dispossessed opted to leave the EU.

Trump won the US election after a vitriolic campaign that tore at social, cultural and political divides and left the rest of the world confused about American power and identity.
Renzi is history, crushed Cameron-style by his own referendum defeat which dealt a second hammer blow to the EU.
And Merkel, rocked by a year-end terror attack in Berlin, faces a fight for political survival in a fall election hinging on immigration politics and a right wing resurgence spurred by her open door refugee policy.
In France, where Islamic terrorism has become more frequent, President Francois Hollande acknowledged his dismal approval rating and nixed a re-election bid . The best hedge against an earthquake election win in May by far right national front leader Marine Le Pen is France's two-round election system that could unite opposition against her.
A March election in the Netherlands promises a strong showing by far right leader Geert Wilders built on skepticism towards Brussels that is threatening the existence of the EU.
Still if Merkel or an establishment rival prevails in Germany, and the hot favorite in the polls to win the French presidency, Francois Fillon, is also victorious, 2017 could be remembered as the year the populist revolt began to ebb.
Adversaries mobilize
As the West reels, its adversaries are mobilizing.
Russian President Vladimir Putin defied Obama's predictions his venture in Syria would end in a quagmire. Now, he seems on the way to restoring the lost Russian influence that he watched ebb in despair after the fall of the Soviet Union.
In Asia, Chinese President Xi Jinping is accelerating that country's accumulation of regional power and challenging US influence and allies in the South China Sea. A volatile President in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, is trashing a prized US alliance.
Trump's rejection of a vast Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact has already empowered China and undermined eight years of Obama's Asia pivot.

The instability and uncertainty makes the choices Trump makes once he is inaugurated in January especially crucial.
Should the new administration follow through on the President-elect's tough rhetoric on China and take protectionist steps that could incite a trade war, tensions in Asia could spike considerably.
If Trump walks out on the Iran nuclear deal or infringes the Paris climate pact, he could send transatlantic relations into a spiral. Aligning the US closer to Moscow could also alarm European allies unless he makes a full-throated defense of NATO on his first trip to the continent.

Asian allies Japan and South Korea are nervously trying to work out what Trump's campaign trail rhetoric means for crucial national security infrastructure in Asia. North Korea, meanwhile, is brewing what could be Trump's first big foreign crisis with its race for a functioning nuclear arsenal.
In the Middle East, Trump's vow to move the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv could light a match to Palestinian-Israeli antagonism and put US Arab allies in a tough spot.
Could Trump's strategy work?
Of course, there's no certainty that Trump will plunge the world into a new spiral of instability. Major policy shifts can be disorienting, but they aren't always negative.
Every President's foreign policy is in some ways a correction to that of his predecessor. So Trump's spontaneity could perhaps be an antidote to Obama's caution, which some critics said frittered away US power.
Questioning trade deals, alliances and conventions could actually end up strengthening the US at home and in the world, Trump supporters argue. And just because the One China policy has dictated relations between Washington and Beijing for decades does not mean it should always be so, they say. Trump's naval buildup, meanwhile, could reassure US allies who feel bullied by China.
And in an era of strongman leaders like Xi, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a harder-to-read US President might keep American rivals off balance.
Foreign policy often begins at home. And if tax cuts and slashing regulation ignites explosive economic growth, a Trump boom could help lift anemic economies in Euorope and Asia.
Those who hope Trump will not upset the geopolitical apple cart also question whether responsibility will sober the President-elect.
""There's just a whole different attitude and vibe when you're not in power as when you're in power,"" Obama said in his year-end press conference. ""What we have to see is how will the President-elect operate and how will his team operate when they've been fully briefed on all these issues, they have their hands on all the levers of government and they've got to got to start making decisions.""",negative
874,"(CNN) Donald Trump gave a lengthy description of his electoral victory, and lavished praise upon a Dubai business partner, during a ten-minute speech to 800 paying guests at his Florida estate Saturday night.
At points throughout his address, Trump name-checked prominent attendees, including ""Hussain and the whole family,"" an apparent reference to his billionaire business partner in Dubai, Hussain Sajwani
DAMAC Properties, Sajwani's company, has built the Trump International Course Dubai. They are currently working on a second course, designed by Tiger Woods, which is set to open in 2018.
""Hussain and the whole family, the most beautiful people, are here from Dubai tonight. And they're seeing it and they're loving it,"" Trump said, referring to the ornate Grand Ballroom that he built at Mar-a-Lago.
Video of the speech was provided to CNN by a person who attended the party.
Trump's comments highlight the complications he faces separating himself from his existing business relationships. Even if Trump creates a wall between himself and his children running his company, he still will know the identity of his pre-existing business partners.
""President-elect Trump is using his largesse as President-elect to enhance his existing business relationships,"" political law attorney Ken Gross told CNN. ""Apparently, in his view, this practice does not run afoul of the representations he has made to date regarding the disentanglement of his business and official functions. It remains to be seen if this will ever get sorted out.""
Trump's transition team said the President-elect and Sajwani didn't discuss their business partnership in Florida.
""They had no formal meetings or professional discussions. Their interactions were social,"" said Hope Hicks, Trump's spokeswoman.
And Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, defended the President-elect.
""This man is allowed to have a New Year's Eve celebration with his friends, or his business partners, or his acquaintances,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""I spent a lot of time at Mar-a-Lago during this break, including I had dinner with the Hussains one night ... Hussain and his wife, absolutely lovely people.""
She added: ""If you took that example to it's extreme, nobody would be able to be friends with anybody else.""
""Nothing has changed,"" Niall McLoughlin, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Marketing at DAMAC told CNN when asked where the terms of business have changes since the election.
""They like each other's company and they were together over the new year as social friends,"" he said.
When asked if Trump or the Trump Organization have outlined a new structure to avoid a conflict of interest, McLoughlin said ""We have been dealing with Donald Trump's children and family over the last three years - Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr.""
""I would be speculating if I commented on any changes in the future,"" he added.
""Our relationship is with the Trump Organization,"" he said ""but Mr Sajwani has a relationship that ""goes back over a decade"" with Mr Trump.
Sajwani's son Abbas posted a photo over the weekend from Mar-a-Lago. ""Scenic,"" was how he captioned a picture from the private club's pool. Photos provided to CNN also show Sajwani and his family attending Mar-a-Lago's Christmas Eve dinner and interacting with Trump.
Trump and Sanjwani's relationship began in 2005. They originally had plans to build a tower in Dubai, but canceled the idea after the global financial crisis.
Trump scrapped a December news conference in which he was set to announce his plans to address his conflicts of interests. Trump has said he will make an announcement sometime before the inauguration. Speaking this weekend at Mar-A-Lago, the first billionaire President-Elect seemed unfazed by the conflicts.
""It is not a big deal. You people are making that a big deal, the business,"" Trump said. ""It's actually a very simple situation.""
In his 10-minute speech Saturday, Trump described in detail his electoral victory, providing a state-by-state recap of places most expected him to loose. He claimed his wife Melania's late campaign speech in Pennsylvania helped turn the state in his favor.
He told the well-heeled crowd he was planning an aggressive beginning to his administration, vowing to loosen regulations and end President Barack Obama's signature health care law.
""Regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare,"" he said, also vowing again to construct a border wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump also provided more detail about his bid to reduce the costs of the new Air Force One. He said that when he met with US military brass following the election, they informed him that a new aircraft would cost in the $4 billion range — a price he deemed unacceptable. Trump had made the claim previously, though hadn't identified where the price figures came from.
US officials, including at the White House, have suggested the $4 billion is inflated. During his speech, Trump claimed to have cut $1 billion from the price tag for the new presidential aircraft.
Trump called the generals who he met with ""beautiful,"" and alleged they made ""Tom Cruise look like dirt.""
Trump praised the members of his Mar-a-Lago club in attendance, who each paid $525 for a ticket to the annual New Years Eve party in the Grand Ballroom. He was less enthusiastic about their guests.
""I don't really care too much about the guests. I don't give a s*** about their guests,"" Trump said.
And he repeated his harsh criticism of the media, claiming they were in the back of the room. (The press assigned to cover Trump's movements was not present in the ballroom during Trump's speech).

""It's as simple as the fear of, is someone simply competent enough to do this particular job? Do they simply have the pure competence to be put in the position of such responsibility?""
Springsteen said he is afraid of what he sees as the effect Trump has had on the future of the US.
""When you let that genie out of the bottle -- bigotry, racism, intolerance, they don't go back in the bottle that easily if they go back in at all,"" he said. ""Whether it's a rise in hate crimes, people feeling they have license to speak and behave in ways that previously were considered un-American and are un-American. That's what he's appealing to. My fears are that those things find a place in ordinary, civil society.""
The musician did note that he could understand how Trump got elected. Springsteen said Trump's ""very simplistic, but very powerful ideas"" could have led Americans who fear threats such as ISIS or job loss to vote for the businessman turned politician.

Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump will say goodbye to 2016 alongside 800 paying guests at his Mar-a-Lago estate Saturday, surrounded by an explosion of white and green flowers in his massive ballroom.
The annual Mar-a-Lago New Year's Eve, which wife Melania and son Barron will also attend, is a highlight on the private club's social calendar, members say. One indicated that prices range from $525 for members to $575 for members' guests — in line with ticket prices in past years.
President-elect Donald Trump arrives with his wife, Melania, for a New Year's Eve party December 31, 2016 at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.
The event is sold out, according to Trump's incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer. He said the bash would begin with cocktails in the mansion's living room, following by dinner and dancing in the Grand Ballroom.
Trump himself added the ballroom onto Mar-a-Lago after purchasing the estate in 1985. The ornate space holds numerous annual fundraisers during the Palm Beach social season.

887,"Washington (CNN) It's Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu against the world.
But perhaps more importantly, the vote -- in which the United States allowed a resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction to pass -- offered a glimpse of how the President-elect and the Israeli Prime Minister are poised to soon overhaul the relationship between their two countries.
Trump and Netanyahu stood shoulder-to-shoulder this week. In days of tense diplomatic maneuvering ahead of the vote, the Israelis enlisted Trump in a bid to stop the measure in its tracks, a striking attempt to pressure the outgoing administration. Trump's response -- a tweet, a statement calling for a US veto and a call with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, whose government originally drew up the resolution -- previewed where he will steer US-Israeli policy.
The Trump-Netanyahu alliance flouts traditional protocol regarding how foreign governments and presidents-in-waiting act. It didn't prevail -- for now -- as the resolution passed on a 14-0 vote, with the US abstaining. The vote was a blow for Israel as the world effectively lined up to censure its settlement building in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, which many nations see as an obstacle to stalled peace talks and the ever more elusive notion of a Palestinian state.
Still, Trump and Netanyahu charted the future course of US-Israeli relations after Trump is inaugurated.
""As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,"" Trump tweeted after the vote.
On Saturday, Trump tweeted, ""The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace. Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!""
Relishing the Trump administration
The Israelis, who accused the Obama administration of abandoning a longtime US ally, made no secret of their relish at the prospect of a new administration.
""Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution,"" Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
Obama's foes in Israel and in Congress, meanwhile, argued that by failing to veto the resolution, the outgoing President was turning his back on diplomatic precedent under which Washington has shielded Israel at the UN. (Presidents of both parties have allowed resolutions that were at least somewhat critical of Israel over the Palestinian question to pass during their tenure.)
Trump, however, has clearly stated his intention to engineer a sharp shift in US policy toward Israel, aligning his administration closer to Netanyahu's right-wing Likud-led coalition.
He has vowed to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, breaking with the practice of several of his predecessors who campaigned saying they would move the embassy during their campaigns but balked once they were in the White House.
Critics of moving the embassy say doing so would inflame Arab opinion and make it impossible for the US to ever be a broker between Israel and the Palestinians in future. The Palestinians see Jerusalem, which is sacred to Islam, Christianity and Judaism, as the future capital of their proposed future state.
Trump's nominee to become the next ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, has been an outspoken supporter of settler groups and has cast doubt on the notion of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
The reset of relations that Trump is promising has notable support in the United States, particularly in Congress, where lawmakers condemned Obama's failure to wield the US veto at the UN. Even some Democrats, including incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, questioned the administration's move.
The President-elect's reorientation of US-Israeli relations could have unpredictable results internationally.
A decision to move the US embassy, for example, would cause outrage among Palestinians and could erupt into violence. It would also likely pile pressure on Arab allies of the US to condemn the move, complicating Trump's other priorities -- notably getting more buy-in from US allies in the Gulf for an escalated operation to crush ISIS.
Moving the embassy and a shift toward Netanyahu could cause fissures with Trump's relations with some European allies already deeply perturbed by his election. It could also intensify interest around the world in the boycott, divestments and sanctions movement (BDS) led by Palestinians to punish Israel.
Footnote for history
While Trump and Netanyahu used the UN resolution to make a statement about the future, the Obama administration was constructing a footnote for history.
The US decision not to veto the move was a clear statement of frustration with Israel because the administration believes its two failed efforts to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians foundered on a refusal by the Israeli government to renounce settlement building.
""It was a parting shot in defense of what the Obama administration and Secretary (of State John) Kerry believe to be the waning hopes of a two-state solution,"" Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East adviser to Democratic and Republican presidents, told CNN.

It was a clear shot at Netanyahu, with whom Obama has had an antagonistic relationship.
The Israeli leader once memorably lectured Obama on Jewish history before the cameras in the Oval Office to the fury of the President's aides. He overtly rooted for Republican Mitt Romney in Obama's 2012 re-election race and used his extensive contacts on Capitol Hill in an effort to derail the central foreign policy initiative of the President's second term: the Iran nuclear deal.
The Obama administration is leaving no doubt that they believe Trump is putting the United States on an unwise course in the Middle East. Speaking after the Security Council vote, Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN, delivered a veiled warning to the Trump administration that it was about to flout decades of US foreign policy.

""The United States has been sending the message that the settlements must stop privately and publicly for nearly five decades, through the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush -- and now Barack Obama,"" she said.
Other White House officials aired their frustration that Trump acted so boldly on the global stage before he assumes the presidency. Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Friday ""there's one president at a time.""
""President Obama is the President of the United States,"" Rhodes said. ""Trump's team will have every opportunity after January 20th to pursue their own policies. ... I'm certain they will on a number of issues.""",negative
888,"Story highlights The Trump transition released a letter sent to President-elect Donald Trump from Russian president Vladimir Putin
The letter offered Christmas and New Year's wishes and urged a better relationship between the US and Russia
(CNN) President-elect Donald Trump on Friday shared a letter he received from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who urged the next president ""to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation"" while offering Trump his ""warmest Christmas and New Year greetings.""
""A very nice letter from Vladimir Putin; his thoughts are so correct,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I hope both sides are able to live up to these thoughts, and we do not have to travel an alternate path.""
In the translation of the December 15th letter provided by the Trump team, Putin wrote that ""serious global and regional challenges, which our countries have had to face in recent years, show that relations between Russia and the US remain an important factor in ensuring stability and security of the modern world.""
Putin continued, ""I hope that after you assume the position of the President of the United States of America, we will be able -- by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner -- to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level.""
The release of the letter -- which was confirmed as authentic by Moscow -- comes days after Russia loudly voiced complaints about its relationship with the US under the Obama administration, and after ambiguous remarks from Trump about the need to ""strengthen and expand"" US nuclear capability to counter nuclear adversaries.

889,"Story highlights Jason Greenblatt will take on the title of special representative for international negotiations
A source said Greenblatt will primarily will be working on Israel-Palestinian peace process and Cuba
(CNN) President-elect Donald Trump is moving a top Trump Organization attorney over to serve as the administration's man to manage sensitive diplomatic and international negotiations.
Jason Greenblatt, the executive vice president and chief legal officer for Trump's business empire, will take on the title of special representative for international negotiations. A source familiar with the appointment told CNN that Greenblatt will primarily will be working on Israel-Palestinian peace process, the American relationship with Cuba and trade agreements.
""My philosophy, in both business and in life, is that bringing people together and working to unite, rather than to divide, is the strongest path to success,"" Greenblatt said in a statement released by Trump's campaign. ""I truly believe that this approach is one that can yield results for the United States in matters all over the world. I look forward to serving on President-elect Trump's team, and helping to achieve great outcomes for our country.""
The Wall Street Journal first reported Greenblatt's selection.
Greenblatt was a principal adviser to Trump on US-Israel relations during the campaign.

890,"Story highlights Trump's inaugural committee has so far struggled to book high-profile acts
The Rockettes will join the Mormon Tabernacle Choir
(CNN) The Madison Square Garden Company said on Friday that the famous Radio City Rockettes dancers would not be compelled, by MSG or their union, to perform next month at President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural festivities.
""For a Rockette to be considered for an event, they must voluntarily sign up and are never told they have to perform at a particular event, including the inaugural,"" MSG said in a statement. ""It is always their choice.""
The initial concern drew in part from a message sent to performers by their union, the American Guild of Variety Artists, in which, according to an email obtained by BroadwayWorld , the AGVA warned that ""any talk of boycotting (the inauguration) is invalid.""
""We have been made aware of what is going on Facebook and other social media, however, this does not change anything unless Radio City has a change of heart,"" the email reportedly said. ""The ranting of the public is just that, ranting. Everyone has a right to an opinion, but this does not change your employment status for those who are full time.""
But in a statement late Friday, the AGVA claimed that its initial message had been misinterpreted by anxious dancers.

891,"(CNN) President-elect Donald Trump lashed out early Friday following son Eric's decision to halt fundraising activities for his charitable foundation amid concerns donors could seek influence with the new administration.
""My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with ... my presidency,"" Trump tweeted. ""Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!""

The verified Eric Trump Foundation account retweeted the President-elect's comments later in the morning, but has not commented further.
Eric Trump emailed the Washington Post on Thursday to say, ""No new money will come into the (Eric Trump Foundation) bank account.""
In an earlier statement, the foundation said Eric Trump ""started his work with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital at the age of 21 the foundation has donated over $15 million and among many other things has completely funded the most cutting edge state-of-the-art ICU dedicated to children anywhere in the world.""

892,"Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump isn't waiting until Inauguration Day to assert his posture on foreign policy, even in areas plainly at odds with the sitting commander-in-chief.
On sensitive issues of diplomacy and national security, Trump has displayed a continued willingness to pressure and contradict President Barack Obama, eschewing a ""one president at a time"" policy that Obama insists must govern the peaceful transition of power.
The most forceful example came Thursday, as diplomats at the United Nations were preparing for a vote in the Security Council on a resolution rebuking Israel for its settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In a morning statement, Trump urged Obama to reject the measure, arguing it ""puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.""
The vote was postponed. But at the time Trump's statement emerged, the Obama administration was still debating whether to abstain and let the measure pass, a gesture that would have been in line with the White House's vocal objections to settlement activity on lands claimed by the Palestinians.
Trump's team informed Obama administration officials ahead of time they were planning to release the statement, according to Jason Miller, a transition spokesman. A national security spokesman for the White House declined to characterize how the message was received.
But administration officials privately say the move, paired with a string of public splits between Trump and Obama, runs afoul of a longstanding custom observed by past incoming presidents to withhold statements or remarks that might be seen as contradictory to the sitting administration and perplex global allies as they await a new commander-in-chief.
""The President-elect clearly is determined to show through any number of moves during the transition that, in effect, there's going to be a sharp break with the policy toward Israel of his predecessor,"" said Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center and a CNN global affairs analyst.
""I think this is unprecedented for a President-elect during a transition to openly oppose an act of diplomacy at the UN in real-time in an administration,"" Miller said. ""It's remarkable.""
Trump's team respects the one president at a time concept, but that doesn't mean he will sit back until January 20, his incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on CNN's ""New Day"" Friday morning.
""President Obama and his team have been unbelievably gracious to the President-elect and his team, but at the end of the day, he's not someone that's going to sit back and wait,"" Spicer said.
""(Trump's) point was Israel is our closest ally in the Middle East,"" Spicer said. ""It is something that we should protect and he wanted to make it very clear that anything that undermined Israel, which is a great friend of the united states, he was going to make sure his voice was heard. and it worked. But look, what is the hit, that he's been unbelievably successful so far as a President-elect?""
Obama held back from meetings in 2008
During Obama's own transition to power in 2008, he withheld extensive public comment about flashes of violence in the Middle East and terror attacks in India that occurred as President George W. Bush was concluding his term.
Bush's aides even invited Obama to participate in a Group of 20 meeting held in Washington shortly after he was elected President. Obama's team -- which at the time was developing an economic recovery plan that differed from Bush's proposals -- concluded his presence at the summit could send contradictory signals to global allies.
Trump, meanwhile, has shown little signs of concern about sending mixed signals about US policy to overseas allies. He's offered foreign policy prescriptions on Twitter and in public remarks that differ from Obama's approach. And he's claimed to be openly negotiating government contracts before he takes office.
This week alone has seen Trump meet with top members of the US military at his Florida estate, followed by a session with the chief executives of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Trump had lambasted the cost of projects those firms are completing for the US government, later claiming credit during a rally for negotiating down the costs of a new presidential aircraft.
On Thursday he tweeted the US ""must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,"" a break from Obama's own policy of reducing nuclear weapon stockpiles. Later, a spokesman clarified Trump was referencing ""the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it.""
Russia and China
The most glaring divide between the incoming and outgoing administrations: Trump's stance on Russia, who the US accuses of meddling in the presidential election. Trump has questioned the intelligence that led to that assessment, leading to a combative public spat between his transition team and the White House.
Disputes over how to handle China have also emerged. When China seized a US underwater drone in international waters this week, the President-elect responded forcefully on Twitter, including making suggestions to the current administration on how to proceed.
""We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!"" Trump wrote. The drone was returned earlier this week.
The messages came after another diplomatic scuffle prompted by Trump's phone conversation with the leader of Taiwan, a move that broke decades of US diplomatic precedent and sparked bombast in Beijing.
Obama himself brushed off the incident in a press conference last week, indicting that Trump's move in itself wasn't necessarily harmful.
But he advised his successor to carefully weigh the consequences of his actions, and insisted that US foreign policy was still under his control for another month.
""What I've advised the President-elect is that across the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you're doing it in a systematic, deliberate, intentional way,"" Obama said. ""And since there's only one President at a time, my advice to him has been that before he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place, that he should want his team to be fully briefed.""",negative
